    "# Homework 10: Cleaning data with Regular Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "Time to use regular expressions!\n",
    "\n",
    "# Hints and notes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Opening files in subdirectories\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that this notebook might be **homework/**, but!!! the csvs and text files might be in **homework/scraped/** or **/homework/scraped/minutes_pdfs** or **/homework/pdfs/**. To open a file in a subdirectory, instead of having the filename be `\"file.csv\"` you'll just use `\"some/subfolder/file.csv\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Opening text files\n",
    "\n",
    "This will open up a file, read it in and show you the first 500 characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "contents = open(\"your-filename.txt\").read()\n",
    "contents[0:500]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> You might need `open(\"your-filename.txt\", encoding=\"utf8\").read()`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using regex\n",
    "\n",
    "For some dumb reason you need to put `r` in front of the string you use when you're talking about regex. Just plain `\"(\\d\\d\\d)\"` will usually work, but *sometimes* it won't and you'll need `r\"(\\d\\d\\d)`. It's best to just use the `r` all of the time, if you can remember!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using `.str.extract`\n",
    "\n",
    "When you use `.str.extract`, you're always going to **capture one thing** and save it to a new column. You need to wrap the things you're interested in with parenthesis `(` `)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "df['phone_number'] = df['old_column'].str.extract(r\"My phone number is (\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d\\d)\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting pandas options\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas has a lot of options, like how many columns or rows it will show you, or how many characters it will show in a column before it stops showing you anything. Here are a few useful ones:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `display.max_cols`: Number of columns to show at once\n",
    "* `display.max_rows`: Number of rows to show at once\n",
    "* `display.max_colwidth`: Maximum number of characters displayed from a string\n",
    "\n",
    "You can set them using `pd.set_option(\"display.max_rows\", 1000)`, for example, to show 1000 rows at a time. You can find a lot more at https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.set_option.html\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regular expressions reference\n",
    "\n",
    "I personally think http://www.regular-expressions.info/ is a wonderful wonderful reference (and tutorial), even if it's ugly! But here's a quick reference for you:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `\\d` is a digit\n",
    "* `\\d*` is zero or more digits \n",
    "* `\\d+` is one or more digits\n",
    "* `.` matches anything for ONE character\n",
    "* `.*` is \"give me anything forever\"\n",
    "* `\\s` is whitespace, a.k.a. spaces and tabs\n",
    "* `\\w` is a word character, which includes capital and lowercase letters, numbers and hyphens.\n",
    "* You can put `*` after anything, so `\\w*` would mean \"as many word characters as you can find\"\n",
    "* `\\b` is a word boundary (you'll need the `r\"\"` thing for this one)\n",
    "* `( )` is a \"capture group\" for saving something\n",
    "* `\\1` is used when doing find/replace to say \"put the first captured group here\" (note, it's a dollar sign instead of a backslash in some editors)\n",
    "* `[ABCDE]` is a character class, which means \"match one of these, I don't care which\"\n",
    "* dollar sign means \"end of the line\"\n",
    "* caret ^ means \"beginning of the line\"\n",
    "* `\\.` means \"no really seriously I mean a period not just anything\"\n",
    "* You can use `\\` with anything else that would normally be a special character, too, not just periods. `(` or `[` or whatever.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cleaning up extracted columns\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes you get `\\n` (newlines) or spaces or `\\t` (tabs) or stuff at the beginning or the end of your column. `.str.strip()` will usually take care of that, just attach it after your `.str.extract()`\n",
    "\n",
    "After you extract something, it's still a string even though you look at it and know it's a number. Use `.astype(int)` to turn it into an integer (no decimal) or `.astype(float)` to turn it into a float (yes decimal)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Writing regular expressions in general\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if I'm using regex in pandas or Python, I like to test them in my text editor with \"Find.\" The highlighting really helps me see if I'm matching things! I also like to think \"what stays the same?\" when designing patterns, write those parts first, then fill in the blanks with what I want to capture."

    "\n",
    "Open up `hm.csv` from the `scraped` directory. I want **four new columns**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `price_original`, the original price, one of the new price\n",
    "2. `price_discounted`, the discounted price\n",
    "3. `pct_discount`, the percent discount\n",

    "\n",
    "**Tip:** Remember that `$` is a special regex symbol! You might need to escape it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tip:** When doing `.str.extract`, the whole match doesn't get captured, only what you put `()` around! Think about anchoring to different points of the string, or things in the string.\n",

DOD  CAF  acted  under  Executive \\nOrder  (EO)  10865,  Safeguarding  Classified  Information  within  Industry  (February  20, \\n1960),  as  amended;  DOD  Directive  5220.6,  Defense  Industrial  Personnel  Security \\nClearance  Review  Program  (January  2,  1992),  as  amended  (Directive);  and  the \\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on September 1, 2006. \\n\\n \\nApplicant  answered  the  SOR  on  July  14,  2015,  and  elected  to  have  his  case \\ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the \\nGovernment’s File of Relevant Material (FORM) on September 9, 2015. The evidence \\n\\n) \\n) \\n) \\n) \\n) \\n) \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n1 \\n \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "included in the FORM is identified as Items 4-10 and is admitted into the record (Items \\n1-3 are pleadings and transmittal documents). The FORM was mailed to Applicant, who \\nreceived it on October 19, 2015. Applicant was given an opportunity to file objections \\nand submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. He submitted an undated \\nresponse to the FORM, which was admitted without objection as Applicant Exhibit (AE) \\nA. The case was assigned to me on December 21, 2015.  \\n\\nIn Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted all but one of the allegations. The \\nadmissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a careful review of the pleadings and \\nevidence, I make the following additional findings of fact.1 \\n\\n \\nApplicant is 56 years old. He has worked for a defense contractor since 1997. He \\nis divorced and has three children, ages 15, 18, and 20. He has a bachelor’s degree. He \\nhas no military experience.2  \\n \\n \\n \\nApplicant’s conduct raised in the SOR included: a history of consuming alcohol, \\nat times, to excess from 1974 to about April 2014; being found guilty for operating under \\nthe  influence  of  alcohol  (OUI)  in  February  1991;  being  found  guilty  for  OUI  2nd  in \\nNovember 1997; and being found guilty for OUI 3rd in November 2010 (See SOR ¶¶ 1.a \\n- 1.d).3 \\n \\n \\nApplicant  began  drinking  alcohol  when  he  was  approximately  15  years  old  in \\n1974. He drinks beer on most occasions. Even after his OUI convictions, he stated he \\nwas  still  was  consuming  two  to  three  beers  a  week.  He  drinks  in  social  settings  and \\nafter hockey games. As a result of his 2010 OUI conviction, he lost his driver’s license \\nfor five years. He completed his probation in May 2015.4 \\n \\n \\nCourt documents establish that Applicant was found guilty of three OUI offenses, \\nin 1992 (1991 arrest), 2000 (1997 arrest), and 2012 (2010 arrest). He was placed on \\nprobation in each instance.5 \\n \\n \\nIn  February  1991,  Applicant  was  driving  home  from  a  friend’s  house  where  he \\nconsumed  about  four  beers.  He  was  stopped  by  a  police  officer  who  had  observed \\nApplicant’s  car  cross  over  the  center  line.  Applicant  was  given,  and  failed,  a  field \\nsobriety test. He was taken into the police station where he refused a breathalyzer test. \\n                                                           \\n1 Item 2. \\n \\n2 Item 4. \\n \\n3 Items 1, 3. \\n \\n4 Item 10; AE A. \\n \\n5 Item 7, 9; AE A. \\n \\n\\n \\n\\nFindings of Fact \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n2 \\n \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "He was charged with OUI and later pleaded guilty. He was required to attend 12 weeks \\nof alcohol education and counseling classes, which he completed.6 \\n \\n \\nIn November 1997, Applicant was going home from a high school football game \\nwhen he was stopped in traffic by a police officer. Applicant had two beers before the \\ngame  and  shared  a  flask  containing  some  kind  of  alcohol  at  the  game.  The  officer \\napparently  asked  Applicant \\nif  he  had  been  drinking  and  Applicant  answered \\naffirmatively. He was then given field sobriety tests, which he failed. He was arrested, \\ntaken back to the police station and given a breathalyzer test, which he also failed. He \\nwas  found  guilty  of  OUI  and  sentenced  to  two  years’  probation,  loss  of  his  driver’s \\nlicense  for  six  months,  and  12  weeks  required  attendance  at  alcohol  education  and \\ncounseling classes.7 \\n \\n \\nIn  November  2010,  Applicant  was  driving  back  from  a  hockey  tournament  and \\nwas stopped by a state patrolman because he crossed the center line. Applicant had \\nconsumed six beers and shared a flask of whiskey at the hockey tournament. He failed \\nthe  field  sobriety  tests  and  was  almost  incoherent  to  the  patrolman.  He  was  arrested \\nand taken to a police station where he was offered a breathalyzer test. He was unable \\nto properly perform the test, which was deemed a refusal to take the test. He was found \\nguilty of OUI and sentenced to six months’ incarceration, five years of probation, loss of \\ndriver’s  license  for  five  years,  and  mandatory  substance  abuse  evaluation  and \\ntreatment.8 \\n \\nThe court-ordered substance abuse treatment involved two mandatory sessions \\n \\nand  Applicant  voluntarily  attended  six  more  sessions.  He \\nto  provide \\ndocumentation of any evaluation done by the counselors, but Applicant stated he was \\ndiagnosed  as  being  an  alcohol  abuser.  Applicant  also  attended  Alcohol  Anonymous \\n(AA) meetings once every six to eight weeks. He last attended an AA meeting in May \\n2015. He continued to drink an occasional beer every few months. In May 2015, at an \\nAA meeting he heard a story had made him decide to stop drinking alcohol entirely. He \\nclaims he has not had any alcohol since that time.9 \\n \\n\\nfailed \\n\\nfor  a  security  clearance, \\n\\nWhen  evaluating  an  applicant’s  suitability \\n\\n \\nthe \\nadministrative  judge  must  consider  the  adjudicative  guidelines.  In  addition  to  brief \\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \\ndisqualifying  conditions  and  mitigating  conditions,  which  are  used  in  evaluating  an \\napplicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. \\n                                                           \\n6 Item 10. \\n \\n7 Item 10. \\n \\n8 Items 7, 10. \\n \\n9 Item 6-10; AE A. \\n \\n\\nPolicies \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n3 \\n \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "These  guidelines  are  not  inflexible  rules  of  law.  Instead,  recognizing  the \\ncomplexities  of  human  behavior,  these  guidelines  are  applied  in  conjunction  with  the \\nfactors  listed  in  the  adjudicative  process.  The  administrative  judge’s  overarching \\nadjudicative  goal  is  a  fair,  impartial,  and  commonsense  decision.  According  to  AG  ¶ \\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \\nthe  “whole-person  concept.”  The  administrative  judge  must  consider  all  available, \\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \\nmaking a decision. \\n\\n \\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) \\nrequires  that  “[a]ny  doubt  concerning  personnel  being  considered  for  access  to \\nclassified  information  will  be  resolved  in  favor  of  national  security.”  In  reaching  this \\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \\non the evidence contained in the record.  \\n\\n \\nUnder Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \\ncontroverted  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  Under  Directive  ¶  E3.1.15,  an  “applicant  is \\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \\nmitigate  facts  admitted  by  applicant  or  proven  by  Department  Counsel,  and  has  the \\nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.”  \\n\\nthe  Government  predicated  upon \\n\\n \\nA  person  who  seeks  access  to  classified  information  enters  into  a  fiduciary \\nrelationship  with \\ntrust  and  confidence.  This \\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \\nGovernment  reposes  a  high  degree  of  trust  and  confidence  in  individuals  to  whom  it \\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \\nthe  possible  risk  that  an  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  safeguard \\nclassified  information.  Such  decisions  entail  a  certain  degree  of  legally  permissible \\nextrapolation  about  potential,  rather  than  actual,  risk  of  compromise  of  classified \\ninformation. \\n\\n \\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of \\nthe national interest and shall  in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \\napplicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \\n\\nAnalysis \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \\n\\nAG ¶ 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption: \\n\\nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \\njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \\nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \\n\\n \\n4 \\n \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "AG  ¶  22  describes  conditions  that  could  raise  a  security  concern  and  may  be \\n\\ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \\n\\n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \\nthe  influence,  fighting,  child  or  spouse  abuse,  disturbing  the  peace,  or \\nother  incidents  of  concern,  regardless  of  whether  the  individual  is \\ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent;  \\n\\n(c)  habitual  or  binge  consumption  of  alcohol  to  the  point  of  impaired \\njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol \\nabuser or alcohol dependent. \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\nof both disqualifying conditions.  \\n\\nApplicant’s three OUI convictions and his drinking history support the application \\n\\nI  have  also  considered  all  of  the  mitigating  conditions  for  alcohol  consumption \\n\\nunder AG ¶ 23 and found the following relevant: \\n\\n(a)  so  much  time  has  passed,  or  the  behavior  was  so  infrequent,  or  it \\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \\nor good judgment; and \\n\\n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol \\nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \\nhas  established  a  pattern  of  abstinence  (if  alcohol  dependent)  or \\nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser). \\n\\n \\nApplicant’s  last  adverse  alcohol  incident  occurred  in  November  2010  and  he \\ncame  off  probation  for  that  offense  in  May  2015.  His  three  OUI  convictions  are  not \\ninfrequent  under  these  circumstances.  Insufficient  attenuation  exists  to  conclude \\nenough  time  has  passed  since  his  last  alcohol-related  incident.  His  history  of  OUI \\narrests  and  convictions  under  similar  circumstances  suggest  that  recurrence  is  a \\npossibility. His current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment are in doubt. AG ¶ \\n23(a) does not apply. \\n \\nApplicant recently decided to totally abstain from using alcohol. He indicated that \\n \\nhe has abstained since May 2015. While this is a commendable start, it is too soon to \\ndetermine whether his abstinence will continue to be part of his life or whether he will \\nuse alcohol responsibly in the future. AG ¶ 23(b) partially applies.   \\n \\nWhole-Person Concept \\n \\nUnder  the  whole-person  concept,  the  administrative  judge  must  evaluate  an \\n \\napplicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s \\n\\n \\n5 \\n \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  \\n \\n\\nthe  conduct, \\n\\nthe  nature,  extent,  and  seriousness  of \\nto \\n\\n(1) \\nthe  conduct;  (2) \\nthe \\ncircumstances  surrounding \\ninclude  knowledgeable \\nparticipation;  (3)  the  frequency  and  recency  of  the  conduct;  (4)  the \\nindividual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \\nwhich  participation \\nthe  presence  or  absence  of \\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \\nfor  the  conduct;  (8)  the  potential  for  pressure,  coercion,  exploitation,  or \\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \\n \\n\\nis  voluntary;  (6) \\n\\nUnder AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \\nof the guideline and the whole-person concept.        \\n\\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered the circumstances that \\nled  to  his  arrests  and  his  current  state  of  abstinence.  Overall,  the  record  evidence \\nleaves  me  with  questions  and  doubts  as  to  Applicant’s  eligibility  and  suitability  for  a \\nsecurity  clearance.  For  all  these  reasons,  I  conclude  Applicant  failed  to  mitigate  the \\nsecurity concerns under Guideline G. \\n\\nFormal Findings \\n\\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \\n\\n \\n \\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \\n \\n \\n \\n\\nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.d: \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nAgainst Applicant \\n\\nAGAINST APPLICANT \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nConclusion \\n\\n \\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \\nclearly  consistent  with  the  national  interest  to  grant  Applicant  eligibility  for  a  security \\nclearance.

Eligibility  for \\n\\naccess to classified information is granted.  \\n \\n\\nStatement of the Case \\n\\nOn October 28, 2014, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \\nReasons  (SOR)  to  Applicant  detailing  security  concerns  under  Guideline  F,  financial \\nconsiderations. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \\n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \\n1992),  as  amended  (Directive);  and  the  adjudicative  guidelines  (AG)  implemented  by \\nthe DOD on September 1, 2006. \\n\\n \\nApplicant  responded  to  the  SOR  on  November  14,  2014,  and  requested  a \\nhearing  before  an  administrative  judge.  The  case  was  originally  assigned  to  me  on \\nFebruary 27, 2015. Scheduling of the case was delayed because Applicant was working \\noverseas. The case was reassigned to me on May 4, 2015. After coordinating with the \\nparties, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n1 \\n\\n\n",
       "on  July  16,  2015,  scheduling  the  hearing  for  August  18,  2015.  The  hearing  was \\nconvened  as  scheduled.  DOHA  received  the  hearing  transcript  (Tr.)  on  August  26, \\n2015.  \\n \\n\\nEvidentiary Rulings \\n\\nGovernment  Exhibits  (GE)  1,  2,  4,  5,  and  6  were  admitted  in  evidence  without \\nobjection. GE 3 was admitted over Applicant’s objection. Applicant testified, called five \\nwitnesses, and submitted Applicant’s Exhibits (AE) A through Z, which were admitted \\nwithout  objection.  The  record  was  held  open  for  Applicant  to  submit  additional \\ninformation. He submitted documents that I have marked AE AA and BB1 and admitted \\nwithout objection.  \\n \\n\\nFindings of Fact \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\nApplicant is a 57-year-old self-employed contractor for a defense contractor. He \\nserved  in  the  U.S.  military  from  1979  until  he  retired  in  2000.  He  seeks  to  retain  a \\nsecurity clearance, which he has held since he was in the military. He attended college \\nfor a period, but he is a few credits shy of a degree. His first marriage ended in divorce. \\nHe has been married to his current spouse for more than 25 years. He has two adult \\nchildren.2 \\n \\n \\nApplicant spent the majority of his military career in special operations. He went \\non  numerous  combat  missions,  conducted  clandestine  insertions,  and  operated \\nundercover.  When  he  retired  he  became  an  entrepreneur  and  started  his  own \\ncompanies.  His  primary  company  was  incorporated,  but  Applicant  had  to  personally \\nguarantee many of the company’s liabilities. He also invested in real estate. His primary \\ncompany  suffered  significant  setbacks  during  the  recession  and  housing  crisis  of  the \\nlater part of the 2000s. His real estate properties lost much of their value. He closed his \\nprimary  company  in  2009  and  has  been  working  since  then  as  a  self-employed \\ncontractor and subcontractor for other companies. He has spent much of the last five \\nyears working overseas in dangerous assignments.3 \\n \\n  \\nThe SOR alleges nine delinquent debts, which include a $58,161 judgment (SOR \\n¶  1.a),  mortgage  loans  (SOR  ¶  1.c  -  $30,994;  SOR  ¶  1.d  -  $351,562;  SOR  ¶  1.e  - \\n$271,900; and SOR ¶ 1.f - $50,688), two business-related debts (SOR ¶ 1.b - $18,028 \\nand SOR ¶ 1.h - $77,115) and federal taxes (SOR ¶ 1.g - $33,882 for tax year 2008, \\nand SOR ¶ 1.i – no amount alleged for tax years 2012 and 2013). Applicant admitted \\nowing most of the debts at some point, but several of the debts were paid, settled, or \\notherwise resolved. \\n \\n\\n                                                           \\n1  Counsel  marked  the  post-hearing  submissions  as  Z  and  AA,  but  AE  Z  was  already  admitted  at  the \\nhearing.  \\n \\n2 Tr. at 118, 123-127, 184; GE 1, 3 AE A. \\n \\n3 Tr. at 28-31, 120, 127-131; GE 1, 3; AE A, T. \\n\\n \\n2 \\n\\n\n",
       " \\nApplicant’s primary company was growing, and it leased a larger warehouse in \\nabout  2008.  The  business  ultimately  failed,  and  the  company  broke  the  lease.  The \\nowner of the warehouse sued  Applicant  personally  and  obtained a $58,161 judgment \\nagainst  him  (SOR  ¶  1.a).  Applicant’s  attorney  is  negotiating  a  settlement  on  this \\njudgment.4  \\n \\n \\nApplicant and a partner had a falling out over the business. The ex-partner sued \\nApplicant  for  $160,000.  They  reached  a  settlement  through  arbitration  in  which \\nApplicant agreed to pay the ex-partner $163,000 by 2010. He paid about $86,000, but \\nhe  was  unable  to  pay  the  remainder  when  the  company  closed.  The  partner  either \\nobtained  a  judgment  for  $77,000  or  sought  to  enforce  the  arbitrated  settlement. \\nApplicant’s  attorney  is  negotiating  a  settlement  for  the  remainder  owed  to  the  ex-\\npartner.5 \\n \\nIn February 2013, Applicant settled the $20,302 business credit card debt alleged \\n \\nin  SOR  ¶  1.b  (alleged  as  $18,028  in  SOR)  for  $10,151,  which  was  paid  in  February \\n2013. Applicant submitted proof in his response to DOHA interrogatories in May 2014 \\nthat the debt had been settled. The February 2014 credit report lists the account with a \\nzero balance, with the annotation that it was transferred, sold, and paid.6 \\n \\n \\nApplicant was due a refund from his 2007 federal income taxes, but he owed the \\nIRS for tax year 2008. The IRS filed a $33,882 tax lien against Applicant in June 2010 \\n(SOR ¶ 1.g). In January 2011, the IRS applied his $15,892 refund from his 2007 taxes \\nto his 2008 taxes. Applicant paid the remaining $5,689 owed for 2008 in January 2013. \\nThe  2014  credit  reports  obtained  by  the  Government  report  the  lien  as  released  in \\nJanuary 2013.7 \\n \\n \\nApplicant owed the IRS $65,863 for his 2012 and 2013 federal income taxes. In \\nApril  2015,  he  submitted  a  proposed  installment  agreement  to  the  IRS  whereby  he \\nwould  pay  an  initial  $915  and  then  $500  per  month  until  paid.  In  July  2015,  the  IRS \\naccepted  Applicant’s  installment  agreement  and  added  his  2014  taxes.  On  June  5, \\n2015,  Applicant  paid  the  IRS  $56,415  for  his  2014  taxes.  On  July  9,  2015,  he  paid \\n$10,000 toward his estimated taxes for 2015.8 \\n \\n \\nApplicant used to own five properties consisting of his residence and four rental \\nproperties. Some of his tenants did not pay their rent, and he also had a property vacant \\nfor an extended period. Applicant bought his home and another property when he was \\nin the military. He still has those properties, plus another, but he lost two properties to \\nforeclosure.

       "mortgage loans on one of the foreclosed properties. The $351,562 figure is listed on the \\ncredit  reports  as  the  high  credit  on  the  first  mortgage  loan,  not  a  balance.  The  2010 \\ncredit report lists the account before foreclosure as $8,609 past due, with a $274,274 \\nbalance. The more recent credit reports list the first mortgage loan as foreclosed with a \\nzero balance. TransUnion reported in August 2015: “Credit grantor reclaimed collateral \\nto settle defaulted mortgage[.] Foreclosure proceedings started[.]”9 \\n \\nThe  second  mortgage  loan  is  listed  on  the  three  oldest  credit  reports  with  a \\n \\n$50,688  balance.  Equifax  reported  a  $50,688  balance  in  the  combined  credit  report \\nfrom  August  2015.  TransUnion  reported  the  loan  as  closed  with  a  zero  balance. \\nApplicant’s  online  account  snapshot  of  the  second  mortgage  loan  shows  a  zero \\nbalance.  Applicant  stated  that  he  thought  the  first  and  second  mortgage  loans  were \\nresolved by the foreclosure. He has never been contacted by the holders of the first and \\nsecond mortgage loans seeking a deficiency owed on the loans.10 \\n \\n \\nSOR  ¶  1.e  alleges  the  mortgage  loan  ($271,900)  on  the  second  foreclosed \\nproperty.  The  $271,900  figure  is  listed  on  the  credit  reports  as  the  high  credit  on  the \\nmortgage loan, not a balance. The reports list a zero balance for the loan. The 2010 and \\n2015  credit  reports  list  the  account  as  “Foreclosure  redeemed,”  and  “Credit  grantor \\nreclaimed collateral to settle defaulted mortgage[.]” Applicant has never been contacted \\nabout a deficiency owed on the loan.11 \\n \\n \\nSOR ¶ 1.c alleges the $30,994 charged-off second mortgage loan on Applicant’s \\nhome. He settled the debt for $7,517, which he paid in August 2015. Applicant is current \\non  the  first  mortgage  loan  on  his  residence  and  the  mortgage  loans  on  his  two \\nremaining investment properties.12 \\n \\n \\nApplicant paid other debts that were not alleged in the SOR. He repaid a $10,000 \\nloan from his former commanding officer. He borrowed $50,000 from a friend who he \\nserved with in the military in an effort to maintain his business. He paid the friend and \\nthen his friend’s widow after his friend passed away.

In  addition  to  brief \\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \\ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \\napplicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. \\n \\n\\nfor  a  security  clearance, \\n\\nThese  guidelines  are  not  inflexible  rules  of  law.  Instead,  recognizing  the \\ncomplexities  of  human  behavior,  administrative  judges  apply  the  guidelines  in \\nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s \\noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \\nto  AG  ¶  2(c),  the  entire  process  is  a  conscientious  scrutiny  of  a  number  of  variables \\nknown  as  the  “whole-person  concept.”  The  administrative  judge  must  consider  all \\navailable,  reliable  information  about  the  person,  past  and  present,  favorable  and \\nunfavorable, in making a decision. \\n\\n \\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) \\nrequires  that  “[a]ny  doubt  concerning  personnel  being  considered  for  access  to \\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.”  \\n\\n \\nUnder Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \\ncontroverted  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  Under  Directive  ¶  E3.1.15,  the  applicant  is \\nresponsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \\nor  mitigate  facts  admitted  by  the  applicant  or  proven  by  Department  Counsel.”  The \\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \\n\\nthe  Government  predicated  upon \\n\\n \\nA  person  who  seeks  access  to  classified  information  enters  into  a  fiduciary \\n \\nrelationship  with \\ntrust  and  confidence.  This \\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \\nGovernment  reposes  a  high  degree  of  trust  and  confidence  in  individuals  to  whom  it \\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \\nthe  possible  risk  the  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  safeguard \\nclassified  information.  Such  decisions  entail  a  certain  degree  of  legally  permissible \\n                                                           \\n14 Tr. at 50, 180-181, 190-193, 197; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 3 ; AE A, U, W, Y. \\n \\n15 Tr. at 25-28, 50-51, 62-74; AE B-L, T. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n5 \\n\\n\n",

An \\n\\nindividual  who \\n\\nis \\n\\n(a)  the  behavior  happened  so  long  ago,  was  so  infrequent,  or  occurred \\nunder  such  circumstances  that  it  is  unlikely  to  recur  and  does  not  cast \\ndoubt  on  the  individual’s  current  reliability,  trustworthiness,  or  good \\njudgment; \\n\\n(b)  the  conditions  that  resulted  in  the  financial  problem  were  largely \\nbeyond  the  person’s  control  (e.g.,  loss  of  employment,  a  business \\ndownturn,  unexpected  medical  emergency,  or  a  death,  divorce  or \\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \\n\\n \\n6 \\n\\nAG ¶ 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \\n\\n \\n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \\n\\n \\n\\n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\nevidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions.  \\n \\n  \\nprovided under AG ¶ 20.

Additionally, the SOR alleged the high credit on the two \\nmortgage  loans  (SOR  ¶¶  1.d  -  $351,562  and  1.e  -  $271,900),  when  the  balances  on \\nthose loans were reported as zero.  \\n \\n  \\nApplicant paid his 2008 federal income taxes. He has a payment plan in place for \\nhis  2012  and  2013  tax  years.  He  settled  and  paid  the  second  mortgage  loan  on  his \\nhome,  and  he  paid  other  debts  that  were  not  alleged  in  the  SOR.  His  attorney  is \\nnegotiating  settlements  for  the  two  judgments  against  him.  Applicant  credibly  testified \\nthat it will take time, but he is committed to resolving all his debts. \\n \\n \\nI find that Applicant established a plan to resolve his financial problems, and he \\ntook significant action to implement that plan. He acted responsibly and made a good-\\nfaith effort to pay his debts. There are clear indications that his financial problems are \\nbeing  resolved  and  are  under  control.  They  occurred  under  circumstances  that  are \\nunlikely  to  recur  and  do  not  cast  doubt  on  his  current  reliability,  trustworthiness,  and \\ngood judgment. AG ¶¶ 20(c) and 20(d) are applicable. AG ¶ 20(b) is partially applicable. \\nAG ¶ 20(a) is not yet completely applicable because Applicant is still in the process of \\npaying his debts.  \\n \\nWhole-Person Concept \\n \\nUnder  the  whole-person  concept,  the  administrative  judge  must  evaluate  an \\n \\napplicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s \\nconduct  and  all  relevant  circumstances.  The  administrative  judge  should  consider  the \\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nthe  conduct, \\n\\nthe  nature,  extent,  and  seriousness  of \\nto \\n\\nthe  conduct;  (2) \\nthe \\n(1) \\ncircumstances  surrounding \\ninclude  knowledgeable \\nparticipation;  (3)  the  frequency  and  recency  of  the  conduct;  (4)  the \\nindividual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \\nwhich  participation \\nthe  presence  or  absence  of \\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \\nfor  the  conduct;  (8)  the  potential  for  pressure,  coercion,  exploitation,  or \\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \\n\\nis  voluntary;  (6) \\n\\n \\n7 \\n\\n\n",
       " \\nUnder AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \\nsecurity  clearance  must  be  an  overall  commonsense  judgment  based  upon  careful \\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \\n \\n\\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions  in  light  of  all \\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \\nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis.  \\n\\n \\nApplicant’s  character  evidence  was  extraordinary.  His  financial  problems  are \\nlarge, but not insurmountable. Applicant credibly testified that he will eventually resolve \\nall his debts. His sacrifices in service to this country have earned him the time to do so. \\n\\n \\nOverall,  the  record  evidence  leaves  me  without  questions  or  doubts  as  to \\nApplicant’s  eligibility  and  suitability  for  a  security  clearance.

He timely submitted documents that were \\nmarked as AE G thought I.

Applicant had no objection to the motion. The motion was granted, and those \\nallegations were withdrawn.1 \\n \\n \\nDepartment Counsel made a motion to amend SOR ¶ 1.a to reflect that the debt \\nwas owed to a state instead of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Applicant had no \\nobjection to the amendment. The motion to amend was granted.2 \\n \\n\\nFindings of Fact \\n\\n \\n \\nApplicant is a 40-year-old mechanic who works as a quality assurance inspector \\nfor  a  defense  contractor.  He  has  been  working  for  that  contractor  in  the  Middle  East \\nsince May 2011 and has worked overseas for other defense contractors for a number of \\nyears.  He  earned  a  general  educational  development  certificate  in  1996  and  an \\nassociate’s degree in 2003. He has been married twice. He married his current wife in \\n2005. He has three children, ages 15, 16, and 22.3 \\n \\n\\nExcluding  the  withdrawn  allegations,  the  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  had  three \\ndelinquent  debts  totaling  $64,168  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.c).  In  his  Answer  to  the  SOR,  he \\ndenied each debt. Substantial evidence of the alleged debts is contained in GE 1-4.4  \\n\\n \\nIn 1999, Applicant was involved in a car accident and incurred a broken pelvis \\nand hip. He was determined to be fully disabled and collected about $1,000 per month \\nin disability payments from the Social Security Administration (SSA). While receiving the \\ndisability benefits, he knew there was a limit on how much income he could earn, but \\ndid not know the exact restrictions. In 2006, he received a letter from SSA that indicated \\n                                                           \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n1 Tr. 23-25.  \\n\\n2 Tr. 43-44.  \\n\\n3 Tr. 5-7, 23, 37-39, 42-43; GE 1. \\n\\n4 GE 1-4; Applicant’s Answer to the SOR.  \\n\\n \\n2 \\n \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "he was earning more income than he was allowed. At that time, his disability payments \\nstopped, and he has not received any further disability payments since then.5 \\n\\n \\nA credit report dated June 12, 2010, reflected that Applicant’s SSA account had \\nbeen  placed  for  collection  in  the  amount  of  $20,955  (SOR  ¶  1.c).  This  delinquent \\naccount was the result of his overpayment of disability payments. In 2008, he started \\nrepaying this debt through a monthly pay allotment of $300. When he left his job later \\nthat year, the allotment stopped. In 2012, the SSA began garnishing his pay at a rate of \\n$600 every two weeks. By early 2014 (well before the issuance of the SOR), he fully \\nrepaid this debt. In July 2014, he received a letter from the SSA stating he overpaid the \\ndebt and would be receiving a refund of $2,535.6 \\n\\n \\nIn 2008 and 2009, Applicant worked overseas, and a portion of his income was \\nexempt from taxation. In those years, his income was greater than the exemption, and \\nhe incurred taxes that he could not pay. In his security clearance application (SCA), he \\ndisclosed that he owed approximately $36,000 to the IRS for 2008 and 2009 (SOR ¶ \\n1.b). In 2010, his state also filed a $7,213 tax lien against him (SOR ¶ 1.a).7 \\n\\n \\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant stated that the state tax lien had been repaid \\nthrough monthly payroll deductions. He also stated that he had a repayment plan with \\nthe IRS and the payments are automatically deducted from his pay.8  \\n\\n  \\nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that the state tax lien was repaid, but he had \\nnot  yet  received  a  document  from  the  state  showing  it  was  paid.  He  stated  that  the \\ndeductions from his pay for the state tax lien stopped over a year ago. At the hearing, \\nhe also provided IRS account transcripts for 2008 and 2009 that showed he had been \\nconsistently  making  monthly  payments  of  $375  since  August  2012.  As  of  September \\n2015,  his  IRS  account  balance  for  2008  was  $3,961  and  for  2009  was  $17,124.  The \\naccount transcripts showed that his IRS debt had been cut almost in half.9 \\n\\n  \\nBesides the debts alleged in the SOR, Applicant’s credit report dated March 26, \\n2015, reflected that he had no other delinquent debts. He also testified that he had no \\nother delinquent debts. In 2014, he earned about $108,000 and his wife earned about \\n$25,000. In his post-hearing submission, Applicant presented letters from the state that \\nreflected he did not have an outstanding tax liability for 2008 and 2009.10 \\n\\n                                                           \\n\\n5 Tr. 26-29; GE 1. \\n \\n6 Tr. 29-32; GE 1-3; AE C. \\n \\n7 Tr. 32-36; GE 1.    \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n8 Applicant’s Answer to the SOR. \\n\\n9 Tr. 32-36, 46-51; AE D-F. \\n\\n10 Tr. 39-42; AE A, B, H, I; Applicant’s Answer to the SOR. \\n\\n \\n3 \\n \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "Policies \\n\\n \\n\\nThe  President  of  the  United  States  has  the  authority  to  control  access  to \\ninformation  bearing  on  national  security  and  to  determine  whether  an  individual  is \\nsufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. Department of the Navy v. \\nEgan,  484  U.S.  518,  527  (1988).  The  President  has  authorized  the  Secretary  of \\nDefense to grant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it \\nis clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \\nClassified  Information  within  Industry  §  2  (Feb.  20,  1960),  as  amended.  The  U.S. \\nSupreme  Court  has  recognized  the  substantial  discretion  of  the  Executive  Branch  in \\nregulating  access  to  information  pertaining  to  national  security,  emphasizing  that  “no \\none  has  a  ‘right’  to  a  security  clearance.”  Department  of  the  Navy  v.  Egan,  484  U.S. \\n518, 528 (1988). \\n\\n \\nEligibility  for  a  security  clearance  is  predicated  upon  the  applicant  meeting  the \\ncriteria  contained  in  the  adjudicative  guidelines.  These  AGs  are  not  inflexible  rules  of \\nlaw.  Instead,  recognizing  the  complexities  of  human  behavior,  these  guidelines  are \\napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s \\nadjudicative  goal  is  a  fair,  impartial,  and  commonsense  decision.  An  administrative \\njudge  must  consider  all  available,  reliable  information  about  the  person,  past  and \\npresent, favorable and unfavorable, in reaching a decision.  \\n\\n \\nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \\naccess  to  classified  information.  This  relationship  transcends  normal  duty  hours  and \\nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \\npossible  risk  that  the  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  safeguard \\nclassified  information.  Such  decisions  entail  a  certain  degree  of  legally  permissible \\nextrapolation  of  potential,  rather  than  actual,  risk  of  compromise  of  classified \\ninformation. Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in \\nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. \\nOr.  10865  §  7.  See  also  Executive  Order  12968  (Aug.  2,  1995),  Section  3.  Thus,  a \\nclearance  decision  is  merely  an  indication  that  the  Applicant  has  or  has  not  met  the \\nstrict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing \\na clearance. \\n\\n \\nInitially,  the  Government  must  establish,  by  substantial  evidence,  conditions  in \\nthe  personal  or  professional  history  of  the  applicant  that  may  disqualify  the  applicant \\nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \\nof  establishing  controverted  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  See  Egan,  484  U.S.  at  531.  \\n“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. \\nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \\npresume  a  nexus  or  rational  connection  between  proven  conduct  under  any  of  the \\ncriteria listed and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \\n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n4 \\n \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "Once  the  Government  establishes  a  disqualifying  condition  by  substantial \\nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \\nfacts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \\nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue [his or her] security \\nclearance.”  ISCR  Case  No.  01-20700  at  3  (App.  Bd.  Dec.  19,  2002).  The  burden  of \\ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. \\n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \\nif they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   \\n\\nAnalysis \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \\n\\n \\nThe security concern for this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 18 as follows: \\n\\n \\n\\nFailure  or  inability  to  live  within  one’s  means,  satisfy  debts,  and  meet \\nfinancial  obligations  may  indicate  poor  self-control,  lack  of  judgment,  or \\nunwillingness  to  abide  by  rules  and  regulations,  all  of  which  can  raise \\nquestions  about  an  individual’s  reliability,  trustworthiness  and  ability  to \\nprotect  classified \\nfinancially \\noverextended  is  at  risk  of  having  to  engage  in  illegal  acts  to  generate \\nfunds.  \\n \\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \\n\\ninformation.  An \\n\\nindividual  who \\n\\nis \\n\\nAG ¶ 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \\n\\n \\n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and  \\n\\n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nThe  evidence  established  that  Applicant  accumulated  delinquent  debts  that  he \\nwas unable or unwilling to pay for an extended period. AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) apply in \\nthis case. \\n \\n \\napplicable:  \\n \\n\\nFour financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially \\n\\n(a)  the  behavior  happened  so  long  ago,  was  so  infrequent,  or  occurred \\nunder  such  circumstances  that  it  is  unlikely  to  recur  and  does  not  cast \\ndoubt  on  the  individual’s  current  reliability,  trustworthiness,  or  good \\njudgment; \\n \\n(b)  the  conditions  that  resulted  in  the  financial  problem  were  largely \\nbeyond  the  person’s  control  (e.g.,  loss  of  employment,  a  business \\ndownturn,  unexpected  medical  emergency,  or  a  death,  divorce  or \\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \\n\\n \\n5 \\n \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "(c)  the  person  has  received  or  is  receiving  counseling  for  the  problem \\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \\nunder control; and \\n \\n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \\notherwise resolve debts.  \\n \\nApplicant  incurred  delinquent  debts  because  he  continued  to  receive  disability \\nbenefits  after  his  income  exceeded  earning  limitations  and  because  he  failed  to  pay \\ntaxes  on  income  earned  in  2008  and  2009.  These  events  do  not  constitute \\ncircumstances beyond his control. AG ¶ 20(b) does not apply. \\n\\n \\nApplicant  has  resolved  the  state  tax  lien  in  SOR  ¶  1.a  and  the  disability \\noverpayment  in  SOR  ¶  1.c.  He  has  established  a  repayment  plan  to  resolve  the \\ndelinquent  federal  taxes  in  SOR  ¶  1.b.  He  has  been  consistently  making  payments \\nunder  that  plan  for  the  past  three  years.  The  record  established  that  his  financial \\nproblems  are  under  control  and  are  being  resolved.  He  has  not  incurred  any  recent \\ndelinquent debts. His financial problems are unlikely to recur and do not cast doubt on \\nhis current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(c), and 20(d) \\napply. \\n\\n \\n\\nWhole-Person Concept \\n\\nIn  the  adjudication  process,  an  administrative  judge  must  carefully  weigh  a \\nnumber  of  variables  known  as  the  whole-person  concept.  Available  information  about \\nthe applicant as well as the factors listed in AG ¶ 2(a) should be considered in reaching \\na  determination.11  In  this  case,  I  gave  due  consideration  to  the  information  about \\nApplicant in the record and concluded the favorable information, including the mitigating \\nevidence,  outweigh  the  security  concerns  at  issue.

All  allegations  relate  to  his  handling  of  confidential  data  in  December  2007 \\nand January 2008 and his participation in the follow-up investigation in 2009 and 2010. \\nApplicant was assured that “trusted downloads” provided by the Navy and Company L \\ndid not contain classified information, when two of them contained a mix of unclassified \\nand  classified  information.  Applicant  and  his  team  members  transferred  the  trusted \\ndownloads onto computers that were for unclassified use only. There was no evidence \\nthat any of the classified information was viewed by anyone not authorized to view it. \\nApplicant made some judgment errors in his reaction to the discovery of the classified \\ninformation. In March 2008, Applicant’s attorney offered to provide requested materials \\nto the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI); Applicant cooperated with the investigation; \\nand  Applicant’s  errors  in  judgment  are  not  recent.  He  credibly  assured  conscientious \\ncompliance with security rules. He presented a strong case of whole-person mitigation. \\nSecurity concerns are mitigated. Access to classified information is granted.      \\n  \\n\\nHistory of the Case \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nOn  February  11,  2011,  Applicant  completed  and  signed  an  Electronic \\nQuestionnaires  for  Investigations  Processing  (e-QIP)  (SF  86).  (Government  Exhibit \\n(GE)  1)  On  August  18,  2014,  the  Department  of  Defense  (DOD)  Consolidated \\nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued an SOR to Applicant pursuant to Executive Order \\n\\n \\n1 \\n                                         \\n \\n\\n\n",

During  the  hearing,  Department  Counsel  offered \\nseven  exhibits,  which  were  admitted  into  evidence  without  objection,  and  Applicant \\noffered  18  exhibits,  which  were  admitted  without  objection.  (Transcript  (Tr.)  17-21; \\nGovernment  Exhibit  (GE)  1-7;  Applicant  Exhibit  (AE)  A-R)  On  December  22,  2015,  I \\nreceived a transcript of the hearing.   \\n\\n  \\n\\nFindings of Fact \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nIn  Applicant’s  SOR  response,  he  denied  all  of  the  SOR  allegations.  Applicant \\nadmitted the information in amended SOR ¶ 1.b. Applicant’s admissions are accepted \\nas findings of fact.  \\n \\n\\nApplicant is a 56-year-old software engineer employed by Company D, a defense \\ncontractor from 1980 to 2007. (Tr. 179, 214; AE A) From 2008 to present, he has been \\nemployed by another defense contractor. (AE A) In January 2011, Applicant’s security \\nclearance was suspended. (GE 2; AE E)  \\n\\n \\nIn 1998, Applicant married. (Tr. 235) His spouse is a missile engineer, and she \\nhas a security clearance. (Tr. 216) He has two daughters who are 14 and 15. (Tr. 215) \\nHis  father  was  a  career  Navy  officer.  (Tr.  215)  His  two  older  brothers  served  in  the \\nNavy. (Tr. 215) His nephew was a Navy Seal, who served three tours in Afghanistan. \\n(Tr. 215) Applicant never served in the military. (Tr. 235) \\n\\n \\nCompany D funded Applicant’s college tuition, and in 1982, Applicant received a \\nbachelor  of  science  degree  in  mathematics.  (Tr.  178-179,  235;  AE  A)  After  1982, \\nApplicant worked on a variety of Navy contracts for Company D.  Sometimes he was \\nemployed at Company D, but detailed to work on Company L managed projects. (Tr. \\n180) During Desert Shield, he was deployed for six months to the Persian Gulf aboard a \\nU.S. Navy vessel. (Tr. 180) \\n\\n \\n2 \\n                                         \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "In 1999, Applicant was one of the architects of a program for a simulation test of \\npart of a weapons system developed by Company L by utilizing unclassified data. (Tr. \\n184;  GE  5;  GE  6)  From  1999  to  2007,  Applicant  was  instrumental  in  the  program \\ndevelopment. (Tr. 184-189). In November 2007, Applicant went to the Pentagon, and in \\nthe  presence  of  an  admiral,  was  shown  some  design  charts,  which  Applicant  had \\ndeveloped on behalf of Company D, and Company L had previously presented without \\nauthorization to the Navy. (Tr. 189) Applicant believed the information was improperly \\ntaken from Company D by Company L.  \\n\\n \\n\\nHandling Protected Information and Personal Conduct1  \\n\\n \\nApplicant was the leader of a team of technicians working on a Navy project. (Tr. \\n99; GE 5 at 1-2) On about 75 occasions over several years, Company L employees or \\nNavy personnel provided “trusted downloads” on flash drives or compact discs, which \\nwere supposed to be unclassified data or software that Applicant and his team could \\nuse  for  analysis.  (Tr.  94,  99-103;  GE  6  at  7)  Technicians  were  concerned  that  a  file \\nmarked  unclassified  might  actually  contain  classified  data.  (Tr.  87)  The  only  way \\nclassified information could be placed on unclassified computers was through an error \\nin  the  trusted-download  process,  or  a  deliberate  improper  transfer  of  classified \\ninformation. (Tr. 78) Applicant was not authorized to make a trusted download, and he \\ndenied knowingly transferring classified information to an unclassified computer. (Tr. 78)  \\nThere are eight or nine people that could have been responsible for entering data that \\nwas too close to the thresholds to be unclassified. (Tr. 214) \\n\\n \\nApplicant’s team’s project utilized a classified version and an unclassified version \\nof a computer program. The classified version used “a set of parameters, thresholds, \\nwhich [were] put together along with the executable part of the program” to generate a \\n“classified  result.”  (Tr.  100,  107)  The  classified  numbers  changed  as  the  project \\nadvanced.  (Tr.  122-123)  M  was  a  key  person  in  deciding  whether  data  should  be \\nclassified or not. (Tr. 128) The unclassified version of the program used numbers that \\nwere not representative of the real system to simulate interactions, which allowed use of \\nlaptops and communications in an unclassified environment and improved productivity. \\n(Tr. 100-101, 107) The non-representative numbers were used “to test the mechanics of \\nthe  program”  and  debug  problems  in  an  unclassified  environment.  (Tr.  108)  The \\nclassified numbers were not supposed to be used on unclassified computers. (Tr. 112) \\nM assumed the computer he was issued was from Company L and not from DOD. (Tr. \\n113) The unclassified versions could be used at home. (Tr. 100-102) Employees were \\nallowed to use company-issued computers for some personal use; however, extensive \\npersonal use was discouraged. (Tr. 124) At Company L, if a spillage was discovered, \\nCompany L’s facility security officer (FSO) was supposed to be notified. (Tr. 115) The \\nFSO was responsible for ensuring the file was deleted from computers. (Tr. 116) After \\ndeletion of the file, security used a cleaning program to scramble the computer memory. \\n\\n                                            \\n\\n1Unless stated otherwise, the source for the information in this section is a December 16, 2010, \\nletter from an FBI special agent written to the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) about \\nthe investigation of Applicant for unauthorized removal and retention of classified documents or material \\nin possible violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1924.

       "(Tr.  116)  Applicant  had  access  to  classified  versions  of  the  program  and  classified \\nprogram data. (Tr. 118) \\n\\n \\nEmployees  of  Companies  D  and  L  sought  to  maintain  separation  between  the \\nclassified  and  unclassified  versions.  (Tr.  101,  106-108)  In  2008,  the  security  people \\ninterviewed employees and borrowed computers with the programs on their computers \\nto check for a data spill. (Tr. 102) Security found files containing classified information \\non the computers of four to seven employees of Company L, including on M’s computer. \\n(Tr.  102-103,  118-121)  Security  performed  cleansing  operations  on  the  computers  to \\neliminate  the  files  with  classified  information.  (Tr.  102-103,  118-121)  Because  of  the \\nspillage,  the  whole  unclassified-simulation  program  was  terminated,  and  all  future \\nsimulation work was done on the classified side. (Tr. 119, 124) Team members worked \\non  different  areas  of  the  program.  (Tr.  104-105)  Their  work  would  be  subsequently \\nmerged,  which  could  cause  classified  data  to  be  unknowingly  transferred  from  one \\ncomputer to another, and no one would know the origin of the classified information. (Tr. \\n104-105)      \\n\\n \\n4 \\n                                         \\n \\n\\n \\nIn December 2007, Applicant received a trusted download onto a flash drive from \\nthe  Navy  for  evaluation  of  Applicant  and  his  team.  (Tr.  221;  GE  5;  GE  6)  The \\ninformation was supposed to unclassified. Classified files from downloads were labeled \\nwith a C, and unclassified files from trusted downloads were labeled with a T for test. \\n(Tr. 192) In December 2007, B, a GS-13, who was the senior Navy employee on the \\nteam,  was  at  Applicant’s  residence,  when  they  were  doing  some computer  work.  (Tr. \\n92, 192) Applicant inserted a flash drive into B’s laptop computer and was surprised to \\nsee a file starting with a C, which meant the file could be classified. (Tr. 193, 217-218; \\nGE 5 at 2) Applicant had previously transferred the data from the flash drive to his DOD-\\nissued laptop computer without noticing the C-file. (Tr. 217) Applicant and B reviewed \\nthe content of the C-file and determined it was too “inchoate” and lacked a specification \\nto  be  classified.  (Tr.  193)  Nothing  inside  the  C-file  was  marked  classified,  and  the \\ncontent of the C-file never made it into a specification. (Tr. 193-194)  \\n\\n \\nIn  December  2007,  the  information  from  the  flash  drive  would  have  been \\nclassified; however, by 2015, it was clear that at most it was sensitive information. (Tr. \\n194, 220; GE 5 at 2) In 2007, the classification level for the data found on Applicant’s \\ncomputer  was  probably  confidential.  (GE  6 at  4)  B  and  Applicant  agreed  that  the file \\nshould be deleted, and B suggested that Applicant download a cleaning program to be \\nsure  it  was  deleted.  (Tr.  193;  GE  4  at  2;  GE  6  at  2)  They  deleted  the  file.  (Tr.  162) \\nApplicant obtained a cleaning program, which wipes out inactive files. (Tr. 195-196)2 It \\ndeletes files from the recycle bin. (Tr. 224) Applicant conceded it was bad judgment to \\ndelete  the  file  without  going  to  security.  (Tr.  195,  235)  Applicant  has  never  had  any \\nsecurity violations. (Tr. 195) Applicant did not disclose the possible transfer of classified \\ninformation  to  an  unclassified  system  until  August  19,  2010  when  he  met  with  an \\n                                            \\n\\n2Applicant is not the only team member with a clearing program on his DOD-issued computer. C \\nhas a cleaning or deletion program on his computer. (Tr. 80) C understood that if classified information \\nwere  found  on  an  unclassified  computer  the  safest  reaction  is  to  delete  the  classified  information  to \\nensure its protection from loss or compromise. (Tr. 80-81) The spillage should  also be reported  to the \\nFSO. (Tr. 85-86) \\n\\n\n",
       "Assistant U.S. Attorney (AUSA) and others for a proffer session. Applicant promised to \\nreport any spillage that occurs immediately to his company (FSO). (Tr. 214)   \\n\\n \\nOn January 18, 2008, two employees of a rival defense contractor (Company L) \\ntold investigators that Applicant may be responsible for the unauthorized removal and \\nretention of classified materials. (GE 4) \\n\\n \\nOn  January  28,  2008,  Company  D’s  FSO  called  Applicant  and  asked  him  to \\nprovide his two DOD-issued laptop computers to Company L. (Tr. 196, 229) One of the \\nrequested laptop computers was at Applicant’s home. (Tr. 197-199) The FSO did not \\nexplain why the computers were requested. (Tr. 199) Applicant said he would bring the \\ncomputers the next day, and the FSO did not insist or demand that Applicant provide \\nthe computer sooner. (GE 6 at 6) Applicant did not believe there had been classified \\ninformation on the laptop computers. (Tr. 200) Applicant said he deleted  some family \\npictures and other personal information that he did not want to release. (Tr. 139-140, \\n162-163,  169-170,  202,  227-229)  On  January  29,  2008,  Applicant  turned  in  the  two \\nlaptop computers. (GE 6 at 2) \\n\\n \\nIn  early  February  2008,  Applicant  went  to  another  state  where  there  was  a \\ncomputer  with  the  same  program.  Two  subject  matter  experts  (SMEs),  who  were \\nassociated with Applicant’s team, reviewed the “unclassified data” on the hard drive and \\ndetermined  that  there was  probably  classified  data  on  the  computer.  (Tr.  76-77,  205, \\n213;  GE  6  at  2-3)  Most  of  the  information  was  unclassified;  however,  the  classified \\ninformation  was  one  table  of  numbers  or  parameters,  and  none  of  the  SMEs  were \\naware  of  how  the  classified  table  had  migrated  from  the  classified  system  to  the \\nunclassified  system.  (Tr.  77,  88,  90,  213,  232-233)  In  February  2008,  Applicant \\ncontacted Company D’s FSO and advised her of the possibility of confidential data on \\nteam computers. The computers were collected to detect any spillage. (Tr. 205-206; GE \\n6 at 4) One of the SMEs also contacted his FSO about the possible spillage. (Tr. 206)   \\n\\n \\nApplicant  consulted  a  Navy  captain,  who  advised  Applicant  to  seek  the \\nassistance of counsel, and in February 2008, he hired a counsel with significant national \\nsecurity  experience.  (Tr.  203;  GE  5  at  2;  GE  6  at  4;  AE  M)  On  March  4,  2008, \\nApplicant’s  counsel  disclosed  to  the  FBI  that  Applicant  deleted  the  Company  D \\nproprietary files because Company L had requested the computers. (AE B at 2-3)  \\n\\n \\nAfter receipt of the first two computers, the Naval Criminal Investigative Service \\n(NCIS)  and  FBI  wanted  to  check  a  laptop  computer  and  a  desk  top  computer  in \\nApplicant’s  possession  for  spillage.  NCIS  requested  the  two  computers  in  February \\n2008. (Tr. 141; AE B) Applicant had saved tax returns and other personal information on \\nthe  desktop  computer.  The  desk  top  computer  was  obsolete  and  lacked  sufficient \\ncomputer  power  to  run  simulations,  and  Applicant  believed  it  had  no  risk  of  having \\nclassified data on it. (Tr. 210) Applicant’s attorney wanted to find out whether the two \\ncomputers were owned by Applicant, Company D, or DOD before providing them to the \\nFBI  or  NCIS.  (Tr.  141)  With  the  assistance  of  Company  D,  Applicant’s  attorney \\ndetermined  the  two  computers  were  probably  owned  by  DOD.  On  March  4,  2008, \\nApplicant’s  attorney  wrote  the  FBI  volunteering  to  have  Applicant  provide  the  two \\n\\n \\n5 \\n                                         \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "computers to the FBI. (Tr. 143-147, 164-165, 226; AE B; AE H) The FBI did not allege \\nthat  there  were  deletions  from  the  two  computers  Applicant  provided  in  March  2008; \\nhowever, Applicant said the Company D proprietary information that he did not want to \\nrelease to Company L was on the second set of computers provided to NCIS and the \\nFBI. (Tr. 228-230) Applicant deleted the Company D proprietary information. (Tr. 228-\\n232) Applicant’s attorney disclosed to the FBI that she had retained a copy of the hard \\ndrive of the desktop computer in her office safe. (Tr. 144; AE B) The FBI never asked \\nfor the copy of the hard drive. (Tr. 144-145) There is no evidence that the FBI found any \\nclassified information on the two computers provided on March 4, 2008. (Tr. 172)       \\n\\n \\nInvestigators checked some of the computers used in the project; however, they \\ndid  not  check  all  of the  other  computers  used  on the project  that  logically  might  also \\nhave spillage. (Tr. 79, 81, 88-89) C assumed that Company L was out to get Applicant \\nbecause  of  how  he  was  targeted  by  the  investigation.  (Tr.  82-83)  The  FBI  did  not \\ninterview C. (Tr. 80) \\n\\n \\nOn August 19, 2010, Applicant and his counsel met with an AUSA and others for \\na proffer session. (Tr. 149) Applicant advised the FBI that Applicant had compact discs \\nthat he  received from  Company  L  with  trusted  downloads for  testing  simulations.  (Tr. \\n156-159,  210,  212)  The  discs  were  marked  unclassified.  (Tr.  210)  Applicant  also \\ndisclosed  he  had  the  flash  drive  that  contained  the  C-file  that  he  downloaded  on  his \\ncomputer in December 2007. (Tr. 222) He had previously deleted the C-file off of the \\nflash drive. (Tr. 224) On August 23, 2010, Applicant provided the requested compact \\ndiscs and flash drive to the NCIS. (Tr. 159, 170, 222; AE H)  \\n\\n \\nAt  the  August  19,  2010  proffer,  AUSA,  an  FBI  special  agent,  and  two  NCIS \\nspecial agents asked Applicant numerous questions about the computers, project, and \\nclassified  data.  (Tr.  150;  AE  C)  The  forensic  examination  determined  that  classified \\nmaterials had been stored on one of the laptop computers. FBI SMEs, who were not \\nrelated to Applicant’s team, reviewed the “classified values” and concluded 11 values \\nwere not sufficiently scrambled to render them unclassified. (Tr. 213; GE 3; GE 5 at 3; \\nAE P) The classification level was deemed to be confidential. (AE L; AE P) Applicant \\nbelieved the FBI SMEs erred in the manner that some of the numbers were “reverse \\nengineered”  and  classified  as  confidential  or  secret.  (GE  6  at  5)  The  FBI  had  been \\nrelying  on  erroneous  information  from  SMEs,  and  the  FBI  SMEs  had  mistakenly \\nconfused some of the unclassified testing numbers with classified data. (Tr. 151, 154, \\n211; GE 3) Applicant agreed with the FBI that one table contained classified numbers. \\n(Tr.  151-154;  GE  5  at  2-3)  Applicant  conceded  his  unclassified  computer  should  not \\nhave  been  used  for  classified  information  because  it  did  not  contain  the  security \\nmeasures required for storage of classified material. (Tr. 155-156)  \\n\\n \\nThe AUSA appeared to accept that Applicant was involved in an inadvertent spill \\nof  classified  numbers  as  opposed  to  a  deliberate  attempt  to  compromise  classified \\ninformation. (Tr. 152) On December 16, 2010, an FBI special agent wrote the Defense \\nIndustrial  Security  Clearance  Office  (DISCO)  about  the  investigation  of  Applicant  for \\nunauthorized  removal  and  retention  of  classified  documents  or  material  in  possible \\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 1924. (GE 3) The FBI letter advised that no charges would be \\n\\n \\n6 \\n                                         \\n \\n\\n\n",

(Tr. 153) \\n\\n \\nFrom January 2008 to August 2010, the FBI and NCIS did not ask Applicant for \\nany evidence. (GE 6 at 7) On March 4, 2008, Applicant’s attorney  wrote the FBI and \\noffered  to  cooperate  with  the  FBI  investigation.  (AE  B)  Applicant’s  attorney  indicated \\nApplicant was cooperative with the investigation. (Tr. 160)   \\n \\nCharacter Evidence \\n \\n \\nA Navy captain has known Applicant since the late 1990s and served with him on \\nmore than one tour at sea. (Tr. 26-27) He has reviewed the SOR and two of Applicant’s \\naffidavits  related  to  the  SOR.  (Tr.  28-29;  GE  5;  GE  6)  He  described  Applicant  as  an \\n“incredibly  gifted”  and  “incredibly  skilled”  technician.

(Tr. 34) On one occasion aboard a warship at sea, \\nthrough  Applicant’s  diligent  and  inspired  efforts,  he  was  able  to  make  a  “great \\nbreakthrough”  with  the  operation  of  a  vital  weapons  system.  (Tr.  32)  Applicant  is \\nconscientious about the protection of classified information. (Tr. 33) He recommended \\nreinstatement  of  Applicant’s  security  clearance  through  the  top  secret  with  access  to \\nsensitive compartmented information (TS/SCI) level. (Tr. 37-38)  \\n \\n \\nA  high-level  DOD  employee  with  TS/SCI  access,  who  has  oversight  authority \\nover about 9,000 of DOD employees and a $300 million budget, traveled thousands of \\nmiles  at  his  own  expense  to  support  Applicant.

(Tr. 44-45; GE 5; GE 6) Applicant occasionally \\ndiscovered  design  flaws  with  Company  L’s  work,  and  some  Company  L  employees \\nresented  Applicant.  (Tr.  48)  Applicant’s  comments  may  have  cost  Company  L  some \\naward fees that might have otherwise been awarded by the Navy contracting officers. \\n(Tr. 48) Applicant is intellectually gifted, talented, professional, and exceptionally diligent \\nand dedicated to mission accomplishment. (Tr. 50-51) He recommended reinstatement \\nof Applicant’s security clearance. (Tr. 55)  \\n \\n \\nA  program  director  on  a  project  has  known  Applicant  since  2003.

(Tr.  66-67)  He  has  complete  confidence  in  Applicant’s  ability  to \\nprotect classified information and recommends reinstatement of his access to classified \\ninformation.

As  Commander  in  Chief,  the  President  has  the \\nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \\nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. \\nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \\napplicant’s  eligibility  for  access  to  classified  information  “only  upon  a  finding  that  it  is \\nclearly  consistent  with  the  national  interest  to  do  so.”  Exec.  Or.  10865,  Safeguarding \\nClassified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  \\n \\n\\nEligibility  for  a  security  clearance  is  predicated  upon  the  applicant  meeting  the \\ncriteria  contained  in  the  revised  adjudicative  guidelines.  These  guidelines  are  not \\ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \\nguidelines  are  applied  in  conjunction  with  an  evaluation  of  the  whole  person.  An \\nadministrative \\nimpartial,  and \\ncommonsense  decision.  An  administrative  judge  must  consider  all  available,  reliable \\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \\n\\njudge’s  overarching  adjudicative  goal \\n\\n  \\nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \\naccess  to  classified  information.  This  relationship  transcends  normal  duty  hours  and \\nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \\npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \\nabout  potential,  rather  than  actual,  risk  of  compromise  of  classified  information. \\nClearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \\n\\nis  a \\n\\nfair, \\n\\n \\n8 \\n                                         \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. \\nThis decision is not based, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination \\nabout applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. Thus, any decision to deny a security \\nclearance  is  merely  an  indication  the  applicant  has  not  met  the  strict  guidelines  the \\nPresident and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  \\n\\n \\n \\nInitially,  the  Government  must  establish,  by  substantial  evidence,  conditions  in \\nthe  personal  or  professional  history  of  the  applicant  that  may  disqualify  the  applicant \\nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \\nof  establishing  controverted  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  See  Egan,  484  U.S.  at  531. \\n“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. \\nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \\npresume  a  nexus  or  rational  connection  between  proven  conduct  under  any  of  the \\ncriteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \\nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \\n \\n\\nOnce  the  Government  establishes  a  disqualifying  condition  by  substantial \\nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \\nfacts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \\nis  clearly  consistent  with  the  national  interest  to  grant  or  continue  his  security \\nclearance.”  ISCR  Case  No.  01-20700  at  3  (App.  Bd.  Dec.  19,  2002).  The  burden  of \\ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. \\n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \\nif they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).  \\n \\n\\nAnalysis \\n\\n \\nPersonal Conduct \\n \\n\\nAG ¶ 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \\n \\nConduct  involving  questionable  judgment,  lack  of  candor,  dishonesty,  or \\nunwillingness  to  comply  with  rules  and  regulations  can  raise  questions \\nabout  an  individual's  reliability,  trustworthiness  and  ability  to  protect \\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \\nand  candid  answers  during  the  security  clearance  process  or  any  other \\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \\n \\nTwo  personal  conduct  disqualifying  conditions  under  AG  ¶  16  are  potentially \\n\\napplicable. Those two disqualifying conditions provide:   \\n\\n \\n(d)  credible  adverse  information  that  is  not  explicitly  covered  under  any \\nother  guideline  and  may  not  be  sufficient  by  itself  for  an  adverse \\ndetermination,  but  which,  when  combined  with  all  available  information \\nsupports  a  whole-person  assessment  of  questionable \\njudgment, \\nuntrustworthiness,  unreliability,  lack  of  candor,  unwillingness  to  comply \\nwith  rules  and  regulations,  or  other  characteristics  indicating  that  the \\n\\n \\n9 \\n                                         \\n \\n\\n\n",

The  hard  drive  of  one  of  Applicant’s  computers  was  restricted  to \\nunclassified information use, and it was found to contain some classified data. Applicant \\nwas  unaware  his  computer  contained  classified  information.  He  is not  responsible for \\n“trusted  downloads,”  and  he  inadvertently  downloaded  classified  information  from  a \\ntrusted  download  onto  his  hard  drive.

Applicant did not believe they contained classified information. On August \\n23, 2010, Applicant provided the compact discs and flash drive. There is no information \\nthat they contained classified information.   \\n\\n \\nSOR ¶ 1.e alleges Applicant had two computers that he provided to his attorney, \\nand his attorney retained them as of December 2010. Applicant had four computers that \\nwere  requested  by  Company  D.  Two  were  requested  on  January  28,  2008,  and  he \\nturned two of them into Company D on January 29, 2008.

       "Further analysis concerning applicability of mitigating conditions is required. The \\nAppeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving the applicability \\nof mitigating conditions as follows:  \\n\\n \\nOnce  a  concern  arises  regarding  an  Applicant’s  security  clearance \\neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \\nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \\nCir.  1990),  cert.  denied,  499  U.S.  905  (1991).  After  the  Government \\npresents  evidence  raising  security  concerns,  the  burden  shifts  to  the \\napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The \\nstandard  applicable  in  security  clearance  decisions  is  that  articulated  in \\nEgan,  supra.  “Any  doubt  concerning  personnel  being  considered  for \\naccess  to  classified  information  will  be  resolved  in  favor  of  the  national \\nsecurity.” Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b).  \\n \\n\\nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  \\n\\n \\nThree mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 17 are potentially applicable:  \\n \\n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \\nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \\nunlikely  to  recur  and  does  not  cast  doubt  on  the  individual's  reliability, \\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \\n \\n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \\nto  change  the  behavior  or  taken  other  positive  steps  to  alleviate  the \\nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \\nor  other  inappropriate  behavior,  and  such  behavior  is  unlikely  to  recur;  \\nand \\n \\n(e)  the  individual  has  taken  positive  steps  to  reduce  or  eliminate \\nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \\n \\nAG ¶ 16(e) is mitigated by AG ¶ 17(e) because Applicant has fully disclosed his \\nrule violations. Law enforcement, security officials, and his witnesses are well aware of \\nhis  security-related  conduct,  and he  is not  vulnerable  to  exploitation, manipulation,  or \\nduress because of his security-related conduct. \\n\\n \\nAG ¶¶ 17(c) and 17(d) apply. The only evidence of Applicant’s December 2007 \\nsecurity breach was Applicant’s self-report; however, his self-report was not timely, as it \\nappears  it  was  disclosed  at  his  August  19,  2010  AUSA  proffer.  However,  Applicant’s \\nfailure to report the December 2007 security breach is not recent; the security breach \\nwas  inadvertent;  “it  happened  under  such  unique  circumstances  that  it  is  unlikely  to \\nrecur;”  and  it  “does  not  cast  doubt  on  Applicant’s  reliability,  trustworthiness,  or  good \\njudgment.”  He  admitted  that  he  showed  poor  judgment  in  December  2007  when  he \\ndiscovered that he had downloaded possible classified information onto B’s computer \\nand his own computer, and he failed to report this security breach to his FSO (SOR ¶ \\n\\n \\n11 \\n                                         \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "1.a).  Security  needed  to  assess  the  scope  of  the  breach  of  security  or  spillage,  and \\nsecurity was unable to check other computers and determine who was responsible for \\nthe “trusted download” that caused the security breach.  \\n\\n \\nApplicant  understands  the  importance  of  informing  security  of  any  security \\nbreach or possible security breach, and I am confident he will timely disclosed required \\ninformation. Personal conduct concerns are mitigated. Even if security concerns are not \\nmitigated under Guideline E, they are mitigated under the whole-person concept, infra. \\n \\nHandling Protected Information  \\n \\n  \\nAG  ¶  33  articulates  the  security  concern  relating  to  handling  protected \\ninformation  as  follows,  “Deliberate  or  negligent  failure  to  comply  with  rules  and \\nregulations for protecting classified or other sensitive information raises doubt about an \\nindividual’s trustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or willingness and ability to safeguard \\nsuch information, and is a serious security concern.” \\n\\n \\nAG  ¶  34  provides  three  disqualifying  conditions  that  could  raise  a  security \\n\\n  \\nconcern and may be disqualifying in this case:  \\n \\n\\n(b) collecting or storing classified or other protected information at home or \\nin any other unauthorized location; \\n \\n(c) loading, drafting, editing, modifying, storing, transmitting, or otherwise \\nhandling classified reports, data, or other information on any unapproved \\nequipment including but not limited to any typewriter, word processor, or \\ncomputer  hardware,  software,  drive,  system,  gameboard,  handheld, \\n\"palm\" or pocket device or other adjunct equipment; and \\n \\n(g) any failure to comply with rules for the protection of classified or other \\nsensitive information. \\n\\n \\n\\nAG ¶¶ 34(b), 34(c), and 34(g) apply. These three disqualifying conditions do not \\ninclude  a  requirement  that  Applicant  knew  he  was  downloading  classified  information \\nonto  an  unclassified  system,  and  they  do  not  require  that  he  be  aware  that  his \\nunclassified computer systems contain classified information.  \\n\\n \\nSOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.c discussed previously are cross-alleged under SOR ¶¶ 2.a \\nand  2.c.  In  December  2007,  Applicant  discovered  that  he  had  downloaded  possible \\nclassified  information  onto  B’s  computer  and  his  own  computer.  The  two  computers \\nwere not authorized for storage of classified information.   \\n\\n \\nThe hard drive of one of Applicant’s DOD-issued laptop computers was restricted \\nto unclassified information use, and a forensic evaluation and SME review found that his \\nlaptop computer contained some data classified at the confidential level. Applicant was \\nunaware  this  computer  contained  classified  information.  He  is  not  responsible  for \\n\\n \\n12 \\n                                         \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "“trusted  downloads,”  and  he  inadvertently  downloaded  classified  information  from  a \\ntrusted download onto his hard drive.  \\n\\n \\nThree mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 35 are potentially applicable:  \\n\\n \\n\\n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior, or it has happened so \\ninfrequently  or  under  such  unusual  circumstances,  that  it  is  unlikely  to \\nrecur  and  does  not  cast  doubt  on  the  individual's  current  reliability, \\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \\n \\n(b) the individual responded favorably to counseling or remedial security \\ntraining and now demonstrates a positive attitude toward the discharge of \\nsecurity responsibilities; and \\n \\n(c) the security violations were due to improper or inadequate training. \\n  \\nAG ¶¶ 35(a) through 35(c) apply. As indicated in the previous section, AG ¶ 35(a) \\nis  established.  The  particular  simulation  program  involving  inadvertent  transfers  of \\nclassified data to unclassified systems was changed to a completely classified system. \\nSuch  erroneous  “trusted  downloads”  will  not  recur.  Applicant  understands  how \\nimportant it is to avoid future transfers of classified information to unclassified computer \\nsystems.  He  has  been  counseled  and  understands  that  when  a  security  violation  is \\ndiscovered, it should be timely reported to his FSO. He has a positive attitude towards \\nconscientiously complying with security requirements.  \\n\\n \\nApplicant’s  actions  since  March  2008  show  sufficient  effort,  good  judgment, \\n  \\ntrustworthiness,  and  reliability  to  warrant  mitigation  of  handling  protected  information \\nsecurity  concerns.  Even  if  handling  protected  information  concerns  are  not  mitigated \\nunder Guideline K, they are mitigated under the whole-person concept, infra.    \\n\\n \\n\\nWhole-Person Concept \\n\\n \\n Under  the  whole-person  concept,  the  administrative  judge  must  evaluate  an \\nApplicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s \\nconduct  and all  the  circumstances.

       "Under  AG  ¶  2(c),  the  ultimate  determination  of  whether  to  grant  eligibility  for  a \\nsecurity  clearance  must  be  an  overall  commonsense  judgment  based  upon  careful \\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \\ncomments under Guidelines E and K in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors \\nin AG ¶ 2(a)  were addressed under Guidelines  E and K, but some warrant additional \\ncomment. \\n\\n  \\nApplicant is a 56-year-old software engineer employed by Company D from 1980 \\nto 2007. From 2008 to present, he has been employed by another defense contractor. \\nHis spouse is a security clearance holder; his father was a career Navy officer; his two \\nolder brothers served in the Navy; and his nephew was a Navy Seal, who served three \\ntours  in  Afghanistan.  In  1982,  Applicant  received  a  bachelor  of  science  degree  in \\nmathematics.  During  Desert  Shield,  Applicant  was  deployed  for  six  months  to  the \\nPersian Gulf aboard a U.S. Navy vessel.   \\n\\n \\nA Navy captain, who has known Applicant since the late 1990s; a high-level DOD \\nemployee, who has oversight authority over about 9,000 of DOD employees and a $300 \\nmillion budget and who has known Applicant since the 1990s; a program director on a \\nproject,  who  has  known  Applicant  since  2003;  two  contractors,  who  worked  with \\nApplicant  on  the  project  at  issue;  and  Applicant’s  attorney  described  Applicant  in \\nlaudatory  terms.  Applicant  is  an  “incredibly  gifted,”  exceptionally  creative,  and \\n“incredibly skilled” technician and engineer. He is diligent, intelligent, professional, open, \\ncandid, honest, and conscientious about the protection of classified information. Most of \\nhis  character  witnesses  were  aware  of  the  SOR  allegations,  had  read  Applicant’s \\nstatements in 2011 and 2013, and recommended reinstatement of Applicant’s security \\nclearance.  \\n\\n \\nApplicant’s  SOR  allegations  relate  to  his  handling  of  confidential  information  in \\nDecember  2007  and  January  2008  and  participation  in  the  follow-up  investigation  in \\n2009  and  2010.  Company  L  or  Navy  employees  provided  “trusted  downloads”  to \\nApplicant and his team. The trusted downloads were not supposed to contain classified \\ndata or software; however, there was some classified data mixed in with the unclassified \\ndata. Applicant and other members of his team unknowingly downloaded the classified \\nand  unclassified  information  onto  computers  allocated  to  unclassified  information. \\nApplicant  did  not  compromise  classified  information  as  there  is  no  evidence  the \\nunclassified  computers  were  used  by  anyone  not  authorized  to  review  the  classified \\ninformation. In December 2007, Applicant discovered possible classified information on \\nhis unclassified computer and on B’s computer. B and Applicant agreed that they should \\ndelete  it,  and  they  did  so.  This  error  was  aggravated  when  Applicant  and  B  failed  to \\ndisclose the discovery of the probable classified information on the flash drive and their \\ncomputers  to  their  FSOs.  Applicant  did  not  receive  adequate  training  or  supervision \\nfrom  B,  a  GS-13  Navy  employee  on  this  occasion.  There  was  no  evidence  that \\nApplicant was told prior to December 2007 of the protocol after discovery of possible \\nclassified information on an unclassified computer.  \\n\\n \\nAfter  two  of  Applicant’s  assigned  DOD-issued  computers  were  requested,  he \\ndeleted Company D proprietary information and personal information before providing \\n\\n \\n14 \\n                                         \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "one  computer  to  Company  D  and  one  computer to  NCIS. These deletions  raised  the \\npossibility  that  he  was  intentionally  obstructing  the  investigation  because  forensic \\nexamination revealed there were deletions, but could not determine the content of the \\ndeletions.  Applicant  provided  the  only  evidence  of  the  content  of  the  deletions.  In \\nFebruary  2008,  after  Applicant  made  the  deletions,  he  hired  an  experienced  national \\nsecurity attorney who advised him to cooperate with the investigation. After March 2008, \\nApplicant  cooperated  with  the  investigation,  and  his  attorney  notified  the  FBI  that  he \\nwould assist the investigation. His errors in judgment were made from December 2007 \\nthrough February 2008 and are not recent.   \\n\\n \\nApplicant’s hearing statement was credible. He understands what he needs to do \\nto maintain his eligibility for access to classified information. He has avoided any hint of \\nviolation  of  his  employer’s  rules  or  security  rules  after  March  2008.  He  expressed \\nsincere remorse for his infractions of security rules and errors in judgment in December \\n2007  and  January  2008,  and  he  emphasized  his  determination  to  conscientiously \\ncomply  with  all  security  rules  and  requirements.  I  am  confident  he  will  continue  to \\nconscientiously exercise his security responsibilities in the future. \\n\\n    \\nI  have  carefully  applied  the  law,  as  set  forth  in  Egan,  Exec.  Or.  10865,  the \\nDirective,  and  the  AGs,  to  the  facts  and  circumstances  in  the  context  of  the  whole \\nperson.

Applicant  did  not  respond  to  the  FORM.  I  was \\nassigned the case on December 1, 2015. Based on a thorough review of the case file, I \\nfind that Applicant failed to carry his burden in mitigating security concerns arising under \\nboth Guideline B and Guideline E.  \\n\\n     Findings of Fact \\n\\n \\nApplicant  is  a  71-year-old  man  who  is  presently  not  working  while  his  security \\nclearance is updated. He has earned a high school diploma. He was divorced in 1998 \\n                                                           \\n1 The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \\nSecurity  Clearance  Review  Program  (January  2,  1992),  as  amended  (Directive);  and  the  adjudicative \\nguidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on September 1, 2006. \\n\\n1 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\n",
       "and is now estranged from a subsequent spouse. Facts about this estranged female are \\nunclear,  although  it  appears  she  is  from  Russia,  where  she  currently  resides  with  or \\nnear  family.  He  provided  incomplete  information  on  his  security  clearance  application \\n(SCA)  about  his  family  and  children.  Other  discrepancies  appear  throughout  his \\ninvestigatory record. Applicant presently lives in another country with a female foreign \\nnational  in  order  to  reduce  the  costs  he  would  otherwise  expend  living  in  the  United \\nStates while awaiting a return to work.  \\n \\n \\nAt issue in the SOR are the following facts: Applicant has a wife who is a citizen \\nand resident of Russia.2 They are estranged, but Applicant has no plans to divorce his \\nforeign  wife  because  he  no  longer  believes  in  divorce.  He  has  a  daughter  who  is  a \\ncitizen  of  the  United  States  and  is  currently  a  resident  of  Russia,  where  she  is  a \\nuniversity student. He also has parents-in-law who are citizens and residents of Russia. \\nApplicant met them in about July 1998 on a visit to their home. He again saw them on a \\nsubsequent  trip  to  Russia  with  his  wife.  He  has  had  no  other  contact  with  them  and \\ndoes not know how often his estranged wife currently has with her parents now that all \\nthree  are  in  Russia.  His  father-in-law  and  mother-in-law  are  a  teacher  and  a \\ngynecologist,  respectively.  Applicant  assumed  they  were  Communists  because  the \\nCommunists were in power when he met them. As of 2015, Russia is one of the two \\nleading state intelligence threats to United States interests, based on their capabilities, \\nintent,  and  broad  operational  scopes.3  Applicant  admits  the  Guideline  B  SOR \\nallegations, but did not address them in any manner in his SOR Response.     \\n \\n \\nIn completing SCAs in both August 3, 2009, and March 23, 2013, Applicant failed \\nto  list  multiple  names  he  has  used,  places  of  former  residence,  periods  of \\nunemployment, relatives, and foreign contacts. He told an investigator in 2010 that he \\nhad no problems while working with a particular employer, but later conceded he was \\ninvolved in a harassment suit while working there. Despite a 2010 claim to the contrary, \\nhe failed in 2007 to file an appropriate contact with foreign nationals report regarding the \\nforeign woman with whom he currently cohabitates. Applicant admits these allegations.  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\nPolicies \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nWhen  evaluating  an  applicant’s  suitability \\n\\n \\n \\nthe \\nadministrative  judge  must  consider  the  adjudicative  guidelines.  In  addition  to  brief \\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \\ndisqualifying  conditions  and  mitigating  conditions,  which  are  used  in  evaluating  an \\napplicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. \\n \\n\\nfor  a  security  clearance, \\n\\nThese  guidelines  are  not  inflexible  rules  of  law.  Instead,  recognizing  the \\ncomplexities  of  human  behavior,  these  guidelines  are  applied  in  conjunction  with  the \\n                                                           \\n2  In  some  records  within  the  FORM,  Applicant  indicated  that  his  estranged  wife  became  a  naturalized \\ncitizen in 2007 or 2008 and now resides in the United States, but the discrepancies are never resolved. \\n(See FORM, Item 6) \\n \\n3 FORM, Item 9, at 3. \\n\\n2 \\n\\n\n",
       "factors  listed  in  the  adjudicative  process.  The  administrative  judge’s  overarching \\nadjudicative  goal  is  a  fair,  impartial,  and  commonsense  decision.  According  to  AG  ¶ \\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \\nthe  “whole-person  concept.”  The  administrative  judge  must  consider  all  available, \\nreliable information about the person in making a decision. \\n\\n \\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) \\nrequires  that  “[a]ny  doubt  concerning  personnel  being  considered  for  access  to \\nclassified  information  will  be  resolved  in  favor  of  national  security.”  In  reaching  this \\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \\non the evidence contained in the record.  \\n\\n \\nUnder Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \\ncontroverted  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  Under  Directive  ¶  E3.1.15,  an  “applicant  is \\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \\nmitigate  facts  admitted  by  applicant  or  proven  by  Department  Counsel  and  has  the \\nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.”  \\n\\nthe  Government  predicated  upon \\n\\n \\nA  person  who  seeks  access  to  classified  information  enters  into  a  fiduciary \\nrelationship  with \\ntrust  and  confidence.  This \\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \\nGovernment  reposes  a  high  degree  of  trust  and  confidence  in  individuals  to  whom  it \\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \\nthe  possible  risk  the  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  safeguard \\nclassified information. Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall \\nbe “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \\nloyalty of the applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b).  \\n\\nThe security concern relating to the Guideline B is set out in AG ¶ 6: \\n\\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \\nany  foreign  interest.  Adjudication  under  this  Guideline  can  and  should \\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \\nfinancial \\nto,  such \\nconsiderations  as  whether  the  foreign  country  is  known  to  target  United \\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \\nrisk of terrorism. \\n\\nincluding,  but  not \\n\\nlocated, \\n\\ninterest \\n\\nlimited \\n\\nis \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n3 \\n\\nAnalysis \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\n",
       "Applicant remains married to the female of Russian origin at issue. Therefore, it \\ncan be assumed he maintains some level of affection for this woman, the mother of his \\nchild. It can also be assumed he maintains a bond or ties of affection for their child, who \\nis  now  studying  at  a  Russian  college.  As  for  his  in-laws,  while  their  contact  with \\nApplicant is negligible, it can be assumed his estranged partner has ties of affection with \\nher own parents. Those ties are routinely attributed to the spouse (Applicant) in these \\ncases. Given these facts, disqualifying conditions AG ¶¶ 7(a) and (b) apply:  \\n \\n\\nto  protect  sensitive \\n\\nAG ¶ 7(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \\nassociate,  friend,  or  other  person  who  is  a  citizen  of  or  resident  in  a \\nforeign  country  if  that  contact  creates  a  heightened  risk  of  foreign \\nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \\n \\nAG ¶ 7(b) connection to a foreign person, group, government, or country \\nthat  create  a  potential  conflict  of  interest  between  the  individual’s \\nobligation \\nthe \\nindividual’s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \\nthat information. \\n \\nIn  finding  disqualifying  conditions  applicable,  I  specifically  note  that  AG  ¶  7(a) \\nrequires substantial evidence of a heightened risk. The heightened risk required to raise \\na  disqualifying  condition  is  a  relatively  low  standard.  Heightened  risk  denotes  a  risk \\ngreater than the normal risk inherent in having a family member living under a foreign \\ngovernment or substantial assets in a foreign nation. Russia is one of the two leading \\nstate intelligence threats to United States interests. In addition, foreign family ties can \\npose a security risk even without a connection to a foreign government. This is because \\nan applicant may be subject to coercion or undue influence when a third party pressures \\nor  threatens  an  applicant’s family  members.  Under  these facts,  while  unlikely,  a  third \\nparty  coercion  concern  potentially  exists  in  Russia.  Therefore,  there  is  sufficient \\nevidence to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \\n\\ninformation  or \\n\\ntechnology  and \\n\\n  \\nAG ¶ 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \\n\\nof the mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 8, and find the following are relevant: \\n \\n\\nAG ¶ 8(a) the nature of the relationship with foreign persons, the country in \\nwhich  these  persons  are  located,  or  the  positions  or  activities  of  those \\npersons  in  that  country  are  such  that  it  is  unlikely  the  individual  will  be \\nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \\nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.; \\nand \\n\\n \\n\\nAG  ¶  8(b)  there  is  no  conflict  of  interest,  either  because  the  individual’s \\nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or \\ncountry  is  so  minimal,  or  the  individual  has  such  deep  and  longstanding \\nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to \\nresolve any conflict of interests in favor of the U.S. interests.  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n4 \\n\\n\n",
       "The mere possession of close family ties to persons in a foreign country is not, \\nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in \\na foreign country and an applicant has frequent, non-casual contacts with that relative, \\nthis  factor  alone  is  sufficient  to  create  the  potential  for  foreign  influence  and  could \\npotentially result in the compromise of classified information.  \\n\\n \\nHere,  Applicant  provided  scant  information about  his estranged  wife,  daughter, \\nand  in-laws.  Indeed,  information  about  his  in-laws  is  more  abundant  than  information \\nabout his child and her mother. While his personal ties to his in-laws may be weak, their \\nimpact on Applicant cannot be discerned without more information about his wife and \\nchild. Under these limited facts, no mitigating conditions weigh in Applicant’s favor. \\n\\nThe  security  concern  for  personal  conduct  is  set  out  in  AG  ¶  15,  where  the \\nsignificance of conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \\nunwillingness  to  comply  with  rules  and  regulations  is  defined  ([p]ersonal  conduct  can \\nraise  questions  about  an  individual’s  reliability,  trustworthiness  and  ability  to  protect \\nclassified  information).  Of  special  interest  is  any  failure to  provide  truthful and  candid \\nanswers during the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the \\nsecurity clearance process.  \\n\\n \\nIn completing his 2009 and 2013 SCAs, Applicant’s answers in many areas were \\neither deficient or in conflict. His answers in a 2010 interview were either intentionally or \\nnegligently incomplete  with regard to past  workplace problems and the reporting of a \\nforeign  cohabitant  to  his  former  employer.  If  these  inaccuracies  were  intentionally \\nincorrect, such facts could give rise to:  \\n\\n \\nAG  ¶  16(a)  deliberate  omission,  concealment,  or  falsification  of  relevant \\nfacts \\nfrom  any  personnel  security  questionnaire,  personal  history \\nstatement,  or  similar  form  used  to  conduct  investigations,  determine \\nemployment  qualifications,  award  benefits  or  status,  determine  security \\nclearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities, \\nand  \\n \\nAG  ¶  16(b)  deliberately  providing \\ninformation \\nconcerning  relevant  facts  to  an  employer,  investigator,  security  official, \\ncompetent medical authority, or other official government representative. \\n \\nApplicant admitted all three allegations raised under Guideline E and provided no \\nexplanations or commentary. While his admission to the SCA discrepancies could be \\ndiscounted and his discrepancies found to be the product of negligence, this guideline \\ncould  be  found  in  his  favor.  In  admitting  allegations  that  he  knowingly  withheld \\ninformation and denied having had problems while employed at a place where he was \\ninvolved in a harassment suit, however, the facts tend to indicate that these answers – \\nwithout  more  –  were  intentionally  false  or  misleading.  This  is  particularly  true  in  the \\n5 \\n\\nfalse  or  misleading \\n\\n \\n\\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "absence  of  some  explanation  claiming  forgetfulness  or  another  basis  for  having \\nprovided a negligently entered SCA answer. Therefore, given his admissions, none of \\nthe mitigating conditions at AG ¶ 17(a) – (g) apply.  \\n\\nWhole-Person Concept \\n \\n \\nUnder  the  whole-person  concept,  the  administrative  judge  must  evaluate  an \\napplicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s \\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a). Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) \\nwere addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment.  \\n \\n \\nApplicant failed to do more than admit the allegations raised in the SOR. He then \\nrequested a judgment based on the written record. It is that very record that is full of \\ndiscrepancies  and  contradictions  that  contributed  to  the  security  concerns  at  issue. \\nThere  are  simply  insufficient  facts  to  evaluate  Applicant’s  foreign  kin,  the  SCA  and \\ninterview inaccuracies, or even the Applicant as an individual. This is simply the result of \\na  deficiently  supplemented  record.

He  was  also  advised  of  the  serious \\nsecurity concerns raised by his possession of a current foreign passport and that such \\nconcerns may be mitigated by surrendering or relinquishing the passport as set forth in \\nthe Directive.4 Applicant did not submit a response or provide additional documentation. \\nThe record closed on December 15, 2015. \\n \\n\\nOn  August  31,  2015,  Applicant  acknowledged  receipt  of  the  FORM.3  He  was \\n\\nAdministrative Notice: The Russian Federation (Russia) \\n\\nDOHA  administrative \\n\\njudges  may  accept \\n\\n \\n \\nfor  administrative  notice \\nuncontroverted,  easily  verifiable  facts  regarding  a  foreign  country  from  official  U.S. \\nGovernment reports.

He received a commission \\nas an officer in Russia’s reserve military forces and worked for a time for the Russian \\nDefense Ministry. He immigrated to the United States in 1997 and married his wife, who \\nis also originally from Russia, in 2002. They have one child, who was born in the United \\nStates.  \\n \\n\\nApplicant  became  a  U.S.  citizen  in  2005.  Applicant,  his  wife,  and  his  child  all \\nhave  dual  U.S.-Russian  citizenships.

However, based on the present record, I cannot find that Applicant’s failure to raise an objection to \\nEx. 5 amounts to an agreement as to the exhibits accuracy, reliability, and relevancy. Contrast with, ISCR \\nCase No. 14-03112 (App. Bd.

Individual  applicants  are  eligible  for  access  to \\nclassified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent  with  the  national \\ninterest” to authorize such access. E.O. 10865 § 2. \\n\\n \\nWhen  evaluating  an  applicant’s  eligibility \\n\\nfor  a  security  clearance,  an \\nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \\nintroductory  explanations,  the  guidelines  list  potentially  disqualifying  and  mitigating \\nconditions.  The  guidelines  are  not  inflexible  rules  of  law.  Instead,  recognizing  the \\ncomplexities  of  human  behavior,  an  administrative  judge  applies  the  guidelines  in  a  \\ncommonsense manner, considering all available and reliable information, in arriving at a \\nfair and impartial decision.  \\n\\n \\nDepartment  Counsel  must  present  evidence  to  establish  controverted  facts \\nalleged  in  the  SOR.

       "“security  clearance  determinations  should  err,  if  they  must,  on  the  side  of  denials.” \\nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \\n\\nthe  Government  predicated  upon \\n\\n \\nA  person  who  seeks  access  to  classified  information  enters  into  a  fiduciary \\n \\nrelationship  with \\ntrust  and  confidence.  This \\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of \\ntrust  and  confidence  in  individuals  to  whom  it  grants  access  to  classified  information. \\nDecisions  include,  by  necessity,  consideration  of  the  possible  risk  an  applicant  may \\ndeliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  safeguard  classified  information.  Such  decisions \\nentail  a  certain  degree  of  legally  permissible  extrapolation  of  potential,  rather  than \\nactual, risk of compromise of classified information. \\n \\n\\nClearance  decisions  must  be  made  “in  terms  of  the  national  interest  and  shall \\nin  no  sense  be  a  determination  as  to  the  loyalty  of  the  applicant  concerned.”  E.O. \\n10865 § 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance amounts to a finding that an \\napplicant,  at  the  time  the  decision  was  rendered,  did  not  meet  the  strict  guidelines \\nestablished for determining eligibility for access to classified information. \\n\\n \\n\\nAnalysis \\n\\n \\n\\nGuideline C, Foreign Preference  \\n \\n \\nUnder  AG  ¶  9,  the  foreign  preference  security  concern  arises  “[w]hen  an \\nindividual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the \\nUnited States.” Applicant actively exercised his foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. \\ncitizen,  including  voting  in  Russian  elections  and  renewing,  using,  and  maintaining  a \\nRussian passport. This record evidence raises the foreign preference security concern \\nand  establishes  the  disqualifying  condition  at  AG  ¶  10(a).10  The  foreign  preference \\nguideline also sets forth a number of potential mitigation conditions. I have considered \\nall the mitigating conditions and none apply. Notably, Applicant currently has a foreign \\npassport and is unwilling to relinquish or surrender it. A current or prospective clearance \\nholder  is  ineligible  for  a  security  clearance  unless  s/he  surrenders  it  to  the  cognizant \\nsecurity authority (CSA), invalidates the foreign passport, or receives approval from the \\nCSA for his/her continued possession and use of the foreign passport. See AG ¶¶ 11(d) \\nand  11(e).  Applicant  did  not  supply  any  information  that  any  of  the  preceding \\ncircumstances apply. Accordingly, foreign preference security concerns remain.  \\n \\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \\n \\n\\nThe foreign influence security concern is explained at AG ¶ 6:  \\n \\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \\n\\n                                                           \\n10 Exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen . . .

An administrative judge should consider the \\nnine factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a).15 I hereby incorporate my comments under Guidelines \\nB and C. I gave due consideration to all the favorable and extenuating factors in this \\ncase, including Applicant’s honesty about his foreign connections from the start of the \\nsecurity  clearance  process.  Furthermore,  I  recognize  that  Applicant  left  Russia  nearly \\n                                                           \\n13 ISCR Case No. 07-13739 at 4 (App. Bd.

       "20 years ago and has made the United States his home. However, his possession of a \\ncurrent  Russian  passport  and  close  familial  connections  in  Russia  through  whom  he \\ncould  be  adversely  influenced  raise  serious  security  concerns.  Accordingly,  after \\nweighing  the  favorable  and  unfavorable  evidence,  I  find  that  he  failed  to  mitigate  the \\nsecurity concerns at issue. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with doubts about \\nhis eligibility for access to classified information. \\n \\n\\nConclusion \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly \\nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant access to classified information. \\nApplicant’s request for a security clearance is denied. \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \\n\\nFormal Findings \\n\\nParagraph 1, Guideline C (Foreign Preference)  \\n\\n \\n \\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\nParagraph 2, Guideline B (Foreign Influence)    \\n\\nSubparagraphs 1.a – 1.d:   \\n\\nSubparagraphs 2.a – 2.h:   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n     AGAINST APPLICANT \\n\\n     Against Applicant \\n\\n     AGAINST APPLICANT \\n\\n     Against Applicant \\n\\n____________________ \\n\\nFrancisco Mendez \\nAdministrative Judge \\n\\n \\n8 \\n \\n \\n\\n\n",

       "The Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On\\nOctober 17, 2014, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\\ndecision–security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of\\nDefense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). Applicant  requested a hearing.\\nOn  November  21,  2015,  after  the  hearing,  Defense  Office  of  Hearings  and  Appeals  (DOHA)\\nAdministrative  Judge  Francisco  Mendez  denied  Applicant’s  request  for  a  security  clearance.\\nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive ¶¶ E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\\n\\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge’s adverse decision was\\n\\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\\n\\nThe Judge’s Findings of Fact\\n\\nThe Judge made the following findings pertinent to the issues raised on appeal.  Applicant\\nhas been continuously employed since 2004 and has held a clearance since 2008.  He owes the IRS\\nabout  $40,000  for  unpaid  taxes  from  tax  years  2005  through  2012  and  for  2014.1    Applicant\\nattributed his tax problems to his having spent funds on a wedding rather than his taxes, as well as\\nto inadequate withholding.  Over the past several years Applicant has entered into a number of\\ninstallment agreements with the IRS.  When he is unable to pay, he contacts the IRS and negotiates\\na new agreement.  Applicant has resolved other debts alleged in the SOR.  He has about $700 in\\ndiscretionary income each month.  His budget does not show any payments to the IRS.\\n\\nThe Judge’s Analysis\\n\\nThe Judge cleared Applicant of all SOR debts except those pertaining to his delinquent taxes.\\nHe noted that Applicant has been fully employed for many years but has consistently failed to pay\\nhis taxes in full.  The Judge noted that Applicant did not pay his 2014 taxes, which would have\\nbecome due after the receipt of the SOR.  The Judge concluded that not even the possible loss of a\\nsecurity clearance could motivate Applicant to change his financial habits.\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\nApplicant cites to evidence that he has resolved other SOR debts.  He also points to his latest\\nrepayment plan that, he argues, will enable him to resolve his tax delinquencies.  Applicant’s\\nargument is not sufficient to rebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the evidence in\\nthe record.  Neither is it sufficient to show that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was\\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-06093 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 4,\\n2015).  \\n\\n1The SOR alleged tax debts up through tax year 2011.  The Judge stated that he was considering the non-alleged\\n\\ndebts only in evaluating Applicant’s case for mitigation and the whole-person factors.  Decision at 3, note 7.  \\n\\n2\\n\\n\n",
       "Applicant requests an opportunity to present us with additional information about his budget,\\npayments to the IRS, and resolution of other debts.  His brief also refers to matters from outside the\\nrecord.  We are not able to consider new evidence on appeal.  Directive ¶ E3.1.29.  Applicant notes\\nthat the attorney who represented him at the hearing had requested the Judge not to consider several\\npages of the transcript due to a malfunction with the video-teleconference equipment.  The Judge\\nstated that he did not consider these pages.  Decision at 2, note 6.  Therefore, any technical problem\\nthat may have occurred did not impair Applicant’s receipt of due process.  \\n\\nThe Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the\\ndecision.  The decision is sustainable on this record.  “The general standard is that a clearance may\\nbe granted only when ‘clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.’”  Department\\nof the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).

The  SOR  alleged  security \\nconcerns under Guidelines E (Personal Conduct), B (Foreign Influence), and M (Use of \\nInformation  Technology  Systems),  and  detailed  reasons  why  the  DOD  adjudicators \\nwere  unable  to  find  that  it  is  clearly  consistent  with  the  national  interest  to  grant  or \\ncontinue  a  security  clearance  for  Applicant.  The  SOR  recommended  referral  to  an \\nadministrative  judge  to  determine  whether  a  clearance  should  be  granted,  continued, \\ndenied, or revoked.  \\n\\n \\n \\nApplicant  received  the  SOR  on  January  28,  2015.  In  an  unsworn  declaration, \\ndated February 17, 2015,3 Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a \\nhearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel indicated the Government \\nwas prepared to proceed on August 3, 2015. The case was assigned to me on October \\n5, 2015. A Notice of Hearing was issued on October 28, 2015.

AE  C  was  admitted  over  the  objection,  based  on  hearsay,  of  Department \\nCounsel.  Applicant  and  one  witness  testified.  The  transcript  (TR.)  was  received  on \\nNovember  25,  2015.  I  kept  the  record  open  to  enable  Applicant  to  supplement  it. \\nApplicant  took  advantage  of  that  opportunity.  He  timely  submitted  a  number  of \\ndocuments  which  were  marked  as  AE  J  and  K,  and  admitted  into  evidence  without \\nobjection. The record closed on December 1, 2015. \\n \\n\\nFindings of Fact \\n\\n \\n\\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied, with explanations, all of the factual \\n \\ntreated  as  admissions,  are \\nallegations  of \\nincorporated  herein  as  findings  of  fact.  After  a  complete  and  thorough  review  of  the \\nevidence  in  the  record,  and  upon  due  consideration  of  same,  I  make  the  following \\nadditional findings of fact: \\n\\nthe  SOR.  Applicant’s  explanations, \\n\\nApplicant  is  a  56-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor  who,  since  August \\n2014, has been serving as a systems administrator. He had previously been a systems \\nadministrator,  systems  analyst,  field  engineer,  or  programmer  with  other  employers \\nsince  August  1981.4  He  has  never  served  in  the  U.S.  military.5  He  was  apparently \\ngranted a secret security clearance in 2001, with a renewal granted in 2013,  and what \\nhe referred to as an EBI clearance from 1982 until 1986.6 A 1977 high school graduate, \\n\\n                                                           \\n\\n3 Applicant’s Answer to the SOR, dated February 17, 2015. \\n \\n4 GE 1, supra note 1, at 14-23; AE F (Resume, undated), at 1-3. \\n \\n5 GE 1, supra note 1, at 25-26; Tr. at 45-46. \\n \\n6 GE 1, supra note 1, at 46-47; Tr. at 44-45.

       "Applicant  received  a  bachelor  of  arts  degree  in  Computer  Science  in  May  1981.7 \\nApplicant  was  married  in  August  1984,  separated  in  December  2009,  and  divorced  in \\nJuly  2010.  He  married  his  current  wife  in  October  2014.8  He  adopted  his  first  wife’s \\ndaughter (born in 1976) in the mid-1980’s.9 \\n\\nApplicant and his first wife started drifting apart and went through several years \\nfilled with marital issues leading up to their separation and actual divorce. She refused \\nto  attend  Applicant’s  father’s  funeral  in  1995,  his  mother’s  funeral  in  1999,  his  college \\nreunion, or his niece’s wedding in 2008. He claimed  it got to the point where he asked \\nher  to  help  him  with  something  and  she  refused.  He  experienced  a  difficult  residence \\nreconstruction  project.  There  was  a  lack  of  communication  between  Applicant  and  his \\nwife.  After  the  separation,  attempted  reconciliations  failed.  During  the  period  of  his \\nseparation,  an  employer’s  contract  ended  and  his  position  was  vacated.  He  searched \\nfor  a  new  position,  and  actually  obtained  several  short-term  ones.  During  the  period \\n2004 until 2013, 18 friends or relatives passed away. Applicant incurred several injuries, \\nillnesses,  and  conditions,  and  he  went  through  several  surgeries.  At  least  one  very \\nclose friend noticed the emotional stress that the various issues were causing Applicant. \\nTo  minimize  the  stress  which  really  started  to  affect  him  in  about  2006,  and  to  relax, \\nApplicant \\nturned  to  playing  Internet  games  and  chatting  during  online  dating \\nrelationships.10 \\n\\n \\n\\nUse of Information Technology Systems & Personal Conduct \\n  \\n\\n(SOR  ¶¶  1.a.  and  3.a.):  Applicant  was  employed  by  a  particular  government \\ncontractor  from  May  2010  until  July  2010.  On  or  about  July  24,  2010,  Applicant  was \\nlooking through his personal e-mails on his government furnished equipment (GFE), a \\ncomputer,  and  accessed  some  online  dating  sites,  sports  sites,  and  book  sites. When \\nhe  opened  some  unsolicited  e-mails,  he  found  that  they  contained  photos  of  nude \\nwomen.  One  e-mail  contained  one  photo  of  five  nude  women  and  another  e-mail  had \\none  photo  which  he  considered  offensive,  but  did  not  describe.  He  claimed  that  if  he \\nhad  known  the  e-mails  contained  photos  of  nude  women,  he  would  not  have  opened \\nthem  on  his  office  GFE.

       "On  or  about  July  27,  2010,  one  of  Applicant’s  supervisors  approached  him  and \\nasked  to  see  the  photos  of  his  residence  reconstruction  project.  Applicant’s  GFE \\ncomputer wallpaper included photographs of his then-girlfriend in a bikini. After viewing \\nher photos and photos of the residence, the supervisor departed. What occurred next is \\nunclear.  Applicant  was  initially  of  the  belief  that  she  went  directly  to  the  information \\ntechnology  (IT)  department  and  asked  that  Applicant’s  GFE  computer  be  scanned. \\nThere is also some evidence that Applicant’s  GFE was merely randomly scanned. The \\nactual fact in this regard in unimportant. According to an incident report filed on July 30, \\n2010, the scan of Applicant’s GFE found that he had been accessing websites for online \\ndating which were characterized as “inappropriate,” as well as 15 photos that were also \\ncharacterized as “inappropriate.” Two of the photos were deemed “sexually explicit” and \\n“pornographic” in nature.12  \\n\\n \\nOn  July  28,  2010,  Applicant  was  terminated  from  his  employment  without \\nwarning due to “violation of company policy” and “unauthorized use of GFE for sexually \\nexplicit  or  sexually  oriented materials.”13  Although  the  SOR  alleged  that Applicant  was \\nterminated  from  employment  for  “viewing  pornographic  websites,”  the  evidence  upon \\nwhich  the  allegations  are  based,  the  Incident  History,  simply  refers  to  them  as \\n“inappropriate websites.”14 The two terms are not synonymous. \\n\\n \\nThere  is  no  IT  report  of  specific  findings,  a  report  of  investigation  by  the \\nemployer, a copy of the company policy supposedly violated by Applicant, copies of the \\ntroublesome  photographs,  or  explicit  descriptions  of  what  were  construed  as  sexually \\nexplicit  of  pornographic,  in  evidence.  There  is  no  evidence  of  any  subsequent  alleged \\nmisuse of GFE or violations of company policies.15 \\n\\n \\n\\nForeign Influence \\n \\n \\nOver  a  period  estimated  by  Applicant  to  be  15  months,  Applicant  chatted  with \\nvarious  foreign  individuals  while  playing  online  games  and  involved  in  online  dating.  He \\nexplained  that  to  be  successful  in  these  games,  it  was  necessary  to  “ally”  with  as  many \\nindividuals  as  possible  to  assist  him  in  winning.  The  games  required  communication  and \\noccasional  chats.  Applicant’s  online  dating  resulted  in  “relationships”  with  several  foreign \\nwomen, but none of those “relationships” involved physically seeing or meeting the women \\nexcept by telephone, or photographs and videos.  \\n \\n\\nOne such “relationship” with a woman in the Philippines in November 2009 involved \\nhis sending various sums of money to her via Western Union. Applicant’s two explanations \\nregarding  the  amounts  sent  her  are  inconsistent.  He  told  an  investigator  from  the  U.S. \\nOffice  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM)  in  October  2010  that  he  had  sent  her  $6,000  for \\nplane reservations, $7,000 for her father’s medical care, and $25 for support.

He  changed  the  amounts  during  the  hearing,  and  said \\nhe sent her $2,000 for plane reservations. He added that he also sent her unspecified sums \\non  over  ten  occasions.

He denied having a bond of affection, loyalty, or friendship \\nobligation  for  any  of  the  foreign  nationals  with  whom  he  had  the  aforementioned \\n“relationships.” Applicant entered into an exclusive relationship with the woman who is now \\nhis  wife  in  May  2011.

Once the Government has produced \\nsubstantial  evidence  of  a  disqualifying  condition,  under  Directive  ¶  E3.1.15,  the \\napplicant  has  the  burden  of  persuasion  to  present  evidence  in  refutation,  explanation, \\nextenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s \\ncase. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.36  \\n\\nthe  Government  predicated  upon \\n\\n \\nA  person  who  seeks  access  to  classified  information  enters  into  a  fiduciary \\ntrust  and  confidence.  This \\nrelationship  with \\nrelationship  transcends  normal  duty  hours  and  endures  throughout  off-duty  hours  as \\nwell.  It  is  because  of  this  special  relationship  that  the  Government  must  be  able  to \\nrepose  a  high  degree  of  trust  and  confidence  in  those  individuals  to  whom  it  grants \\naccess  to  classified  information.  Decisions  include,  by  necessity,  consideration  of  the \\npossible  risk  the applicant may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to safeguard  classified \\ninformation. Such decisions  entail  a  certain degree  of  legally  permissible  extrapolation \\nas  to  potential,  rather  than  actual,  risk  of  compromise  of  classified  information.  \\nFurthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of \\ndenials.”37 \\n\\n \\nClearance  decisions  must  be  “in  terms  of  the  national  interest  and  shall  in  no \\nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”38 Thus, nothing \\nin this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole \\nor in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, \\nor  patriotism.

Under  AG ¶ \\n40(e),  security  concerns  may  be  raised  by  the  “unauthorized  use  of  a  government  or \\nother  information  technology  system.”  This  guideline  generally  refers  to  sending  or \\nsoliciting sexually-oriented messages or images, or the downloading, creating, storing, \\nor  displaying  computer  files  of  a  sexual  nature.  In  mid-2010,  Applicant  opened  an \\nInternet  site  on  his  GFE  that  his  employer  considered  an  “inappropriate”  website.  The \\nsole  evidence  pertaining  to  it  was  the  name,  and  that  name,  without  more,  seems  to \\nindicate  it  was  an  online  dating  website.  There  is  zero  evidence  that  it  was  a \\n“pornographic”  website.  In  July  2010,  while  he  was  again  on  the  GFE,  he opened  two \\nunsolicited  e-mails  addressed  to  him.  One  of  the  e-mails  contained  photos  of  nude \\nwomen  and  the  other  contained  a  photo  of  what  he  considered  offensive.  Applicant \\npromptly  deleted  the  e-mails.  He  also  had  photos  of  his  scantily  clad  girlfriend  on  his \\nscreen saver and wall paper. A subsequent computer scan of his GFE conducted by the \\nIT department revealed the access to the “inappropriate” website as well as the photos \\nthat  were  characterized  as  “inappropriate.”  Two  of  the  photos  were  deemed  “explicit” \\nand  “pornographic”  in  nature.  As  a  result,  the  following  day,  Applicant  was  terminated \\nfrom his employment due to “violation of company policy” and “unauthorized use of GFE \\nfor sexually explicit or sexually oriented materials.” AG ¶ 40(e) has been established. \\n \\n \\nThe  guideline  also  includes  examples  of  conditions  that  could  mitigate  such \\nsecurity  concerns.  Under  AG  ¶  41(a),  the  disqualifying  condition  may  be  mitigated \\nwhere  “so much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it happened under \\nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \\nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.” Similarly, AG ¶ 41(c) applies \\nwhere  “the  conduct  was  unintentional  or  inadvertent  and  was  followed  by  a  prompt, \\ngood-faith effort to correct the situation and by notification of supervisor.”  \\n \\n \\nWhile  Applicant  did  not  promptly  notify  his  supervisor,  he  did  confer  with  a \\ncolleague to determine what to do, and he immediately deleted the e-mails in an effort \\nto correct the situation. According to the apparent prevailing community standards, the \\nemployer  considered  two  of  the  photos  to  be  “sexually  explicit”  and  “pornographic”  in \\n\\n \\n9 \\n                                      \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "nature.  Department  Counsel  argued  that  this  was  not  the  only  such  incident  and  that \\nApplicant  “had  a  history  of  viewing  this  material.”39  His  argument  is  based  purely  on \\nspeculation,  for  there  is  no  evidence  to  suggest  that  it  happened  more  than  once. \\nNevertheless,  even  assuming  the  accuracy  of  the  allegation,  the  passing  of  over  four \\nand  one-half  years  from  the  incident  to  the  date  the  SOR  was  issued,  without \\nrecurrence,  is  sufficient  to  conclude  that  it  is  unlikely  to  recur,  and  it  no  longer  casts \\ndoubt  on  Applicant’s  reliability,  trustworthiness,  and  good  judgment.    AG  ¶  41(a) \\napplies, and AG ¶ 41(c) partially applies. \\n \\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \\n \\n\\nThe security concern for Personal Conduct is set out in AG & 15:       \\n\\n \\n\\nConduct  involving  questionable  judgment,  lack  of  candor,  dishonesty,  or \\nunwillingness  to  comply  with  rules  and  regulations  can  raise  questions \\nabout  an  individual's  reliability,  trustworthiness  and  ability  to  protect \\nclassified  information.  Of  special  interest  is  any  failure  to  provide  truthful \\nand  candid  answers  during  the  security  clearance  process  or  any  other \\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \\n \\nThe  guideline  notes  conditions  that  could  raise  security  concerns.  Under  AG  ¶ \\n\\n16(c), security concerns may be raised by:  \\n\\ncredible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is not \\nsufficient  for  an  adverse  determination  under  any  other  single  guideline, \\nbut  which,  when  considered  as  a  whole,  supports  a  whole-person \\nassessment  of  questionable  judgment,  untrustworthiness,  unreliability, \\nlack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \\ncharacteristics  indicating  that  the  person  may  not  properly  safeguard \\nprotected information. \\n\\nAlso, it is potentially disqualifying under AG ¶ 16(e) when there is: \\n\\npersonal conduct, or concealment of information about one’s conduct, that \\ncreates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1) \\nengaging  in  activities  which,  if  known,  may  affect  the  person’s  personal, \\nprofessional, or community standing. . . .  \\n\\nThe  alleged  behavior  consisted  of  being  involuntarily  terminated  from  his \\nemployment  in  July  2010  for  “viewing  pornographic  websites.”  Applicant  has  been \\nconsistent  in  his  rendition  of  the  facts.

       "allegation  failed  to  address  the  issues  related  to  the  e-mails.  Nevertheless,  there  is \\nreason for further discussion. AG ¶¶ 16(c) and 16(e) have been partially established.  \\n\\n \\nThe  guideline  also  includes  examples  of  conditions  that  could  mitigate  security \\nconcerns  arising  from  personal  conduct.  AG  ¶  17(c)  may  apply  if  “the  offense  is  so \\nminor,  or  so  much  time  has  passed,  or  the  behavior  is  so  infrequent,  or  it  happened \\nunder such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on \\nthe individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.”  \\n\\n \\nSimilarly, AG ¶ 17(d) may apply if “the individual has acknowledged the behavior \\nand  obtained  counseling  to  change  the  behavior  or  taken  other  positive  steps  to \\nalleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \\nor  other  inappropriate  behavior,  and  such  behavior  is  unlikely  to  recur.”  Also,  if  “the \\nindividual  has  taken  positive  steps  to  reduce  or  eliminate  vulnerability  to  exploitation, \\nmanipulation, or duress,” AG ¶ 17(e) may apply. \\n\\n  \\nIn  July  2010,  during  a  period  when  Applicant  was  under  substantial  emotional \\nstress,  he  was  involuntarily  terminated  from  his  employment  due  to  “violation  of \\ncompany policy” and “unauthorized use of GFE for sexually explicit or sexually oriented \\nmaterials.” The alleged behavior, both the viewing of an “inappropriate website as well \\nas  the  opening  of  unsolicited  e-mails  each  occurred  on  one  occasion,  over  four  and \\none-half years before the SOR was issued. Applicant took positive efforts to reduce or \\neliminate  the  behavior  of  online  dating  and  game-playing.  He  remarried.  He  was \\nsubsequently  evaluated  by  a  licensed  psychologist  and  found  to  be  free  of  any \\npsychological  disorders.  He  acknowledged  his  behavior.  There  is  no  evidence  of  any \\nsubsequent  alleged  personal  conduct.  Considering  the  fact  that  the  “inappropriate” \\nwebsite dealt with online dating, and not pornography, the significance of the personal \\nconduct  is  minimized.  Applicant  has  reduced  or  eliminated  his  vulnerability  to \\nexploitation, and through his rehabilitative efforts, the  alleged untrustworthy, unreliable, \\nor other inappropriate behavior, is unlikely to recur. AG ¶¶ 17(c), 17(d), and 17(e) apply. \\n \\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \\n \\n\\nThe security concern under the Foreign Influence guideline is set out in AG ¶ 6:       \\n\\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \\nany  foreign  interest.  Adjudication  under  this  Guideline  can  and  should \\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \\nfinancial \\nto,  such \\nconsiderations  as  whether  the  foreign  country  is  known  to  target  United \\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \\nrisk of terrorism. \\n\\nincluding,  but  not \\n\\ninterest \\n\\nis \\n\\nlocated, \\n\\nlimited \\n\\n \\n\\n11 \\n\\n                                      \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \\nAG  ¶  7(a),  it  is  potentially  disqualifying  where  there  is  “contact  with  a  foreign  family \\nmember, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of \\nor  resident  in  a  foreign  country  if  that  contact  creates  a  heightened  risk  of  foreign \\nexploitation,  inducement,  manipulation,  pressure,  or  coercion.”  Similarly,  under  AG  ¶ \\n7(e), security concerns may be raised when there is  “a substantial business, financial, \\nor  property  interest  in  a  foreign  country,  or  in  any  foreign-owned  or  foreign-operated \\nbusiness,  which  could  subject  the  individual  to  heightened  risk  of  foreign  influence  or \\nexploitation.  \\n\\nApplicant  is  not  a  naturalized  U.S.  citizen.  He  was  born  in  the  United  States  of \\nparents  who  were  also  born  in  the  United  States.  His  entire  immediate  and  extended \\nfamily members are also U.S. citizens. There is no evidence (or allegations) that he has \\nany  family  members  or  business  or  professional  associates  who  are  citizens  or \\nresidents of a foreign  country. In 2009 and 2010, he did, however, have long-distance \\nonline and telephone relationships with several women who were foreign-born residents \\nof  various  countries.  Although  he  never  physically  saw  or  met  the  women,  except  by \\ntelephone, photographs, or videos, he did send them various sums of money, estimated \\nto  be  a  total  in  excess  of  $60,000,  allegedly  earmarked  by  the  recipients  for \\ntransportation,  medical  care,  support,  and  release \\nfrom  a  customs.  Applicant \\nacknowledged that some of the women were taking advantage of him in scams, but he \\nwas not aware of the truth until later. He denied having a bond of affection, loyalty, or \\nfriendship  obligation  for  any  of  the  foreign  nationals  with  whom  he  had  the \\naforementioned “relationships.”   \\n\\nApplicant’s online dating and gaming forays with foreign women ceased in 2011 \\nwhen  he  met  the  woman  who  eventually  became  his  second  wife.  The  security \\nsignificance  of  these  identified  conditions  requires  further  examination  of  Applicant’s \\nformer  foreign  “relationships”  to  determine  the  degree  of  “heightened  risk”  or  potential \\nconflict  of  interest.  Furthermore,  Department  Counsel  argued  that  Applicant’s  actions \\nrevealed  cloudy  judgment,  a  lack  of  self-discipline,  and  a  vulnerability    to  possible \\nmanipulation and exploitation.  The SOR alleged that Applicant wired money to various \\noversea  locations  “in  an  attempt  to  incite  the  relationships.”  (Emphasis  added).40  The \\nevidence  is  persuasive  that,  after  nearly  three  decades  of  marriage  and  a  separation \\nand pending divorce, Applicant was active in online dating and simply wished to make \\nthe right social connection with a female. Nevertheless, AG ¶¶ 7(a) and 7(e) are partially \\nestablished. \\n\\nThe  guideline  also  includes  examples  of  conditions  that  could  mitigate  security \\nconcerns  arising  from  foreign  influence.  Under  AG  ¶  8(a),  the  disqualifying  condition \\nmay be mitigated where: \\n\\n                                                           \\n\\n40  It  is  unclear  why  the  word  “incite”  was  used  in  the  SOR  for  that  word  generally  conveys  a  negative \\nimplication, such as to stir up, fan the flames of, provoke, inflame, egg on, whip up, or foment. The evidence seems to \\ninfer another meaning such as encourage, kindle, arouse, or stimulate.  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n12 \\n\\n                                      \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "the  nature  of  the  relationships  with  foreign  persons,  the  country  in  which \\nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \\nthat  country  are  such  that  it  is  unlikely  the  individual  will  be  placed  in  a \\nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \\ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.  \\n\\nSimilarly, AG ¶ 8(b) may apply where the evidence shows:  \\n\\nthere  is  no  conflict  of  interest,  either  because  the  individual's  sense  of \\nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \\nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \\nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \\nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest. \\n\\nIn  addition,  AG  ¶  8(c)  may  apply  where  “contact  or  communication  with  foreign \\ncitizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk \\nfor foreign influence or exploitation.”  \\n\\nIn  assessing  whether  there  is  a  heightened  risk  because  of  an  applicant’s \\n“relationships”  in  foreign  countries,  it  is  necessary  to  consider  all  relevant  factors, \\nincluding the totality of an applicant’s conduct and circumstances in light of any realistic \\npotential  for  exploitation.  One  such  factor  is  the  potential  for  pressure,  coercion, \\nexploitation,  or  duress.  In  that  regard,  it  is  important  to  realize  that  Applicant  never \\nintended to, and did not, leave the U.S. to enter any of the foreign countries, and that \\nhis  sole  intent  was  to  have  individuals  travel  to  the  U.S.  for  brief  visits  to  explore \\npossible continuing relationships. In fact, none of those foreign women ever entered the \\nU.S., and their sole purpose was seemingly to scam money from Applicant. Yes, he did \\nsend the women substantial sums of money, but any “relationships” that he might have \\ndeveloped with them ceased in 2010 or 2011, at least four years before the SOR was \\nissued.  In  those  circumstances,  there  is  very  little  potential  for  pressure,  coercion, \\nexploitation, or duress.  \\n\\n \\nApplicant’s  immediate  family  and  extended  family  still  reside  in  the  U.S.,  and \\nthose  foreign  women  still  remain  overseas  without  any  continuing  contact  with \\nApplicant.  There  is  no  risk,  much  less  a  “heightened  risk,”  of  foreign  exploitation, \\ninducement,  manipulation,  pressure,  or  coercion  to  disqualify  Applicant  from  holding  a \\nsecurity  clearance  because  of  any  close  or  continuing  relationship  with  those  foreign \\nwomen.  While  Applicant  may  have  been  somewhat  naive,  and  displayed  a  lack  of \\njudgment, in falling for scams and sending such large sums of money to strangers, I am \\npersuaded that Applicant’s loyalty to the United States is steadfast and undivided, and \\nthat he has “such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that [he] \\ncan be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.” AG ¶¶ \\n8(a), 8(b), and 8(f) apply. \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n13 \\n\\n                                      \\n \\n\\n\n",

Applicant  was \\ninvoluntarily  terminated  from  his  employment  due  to  “violation  of  company  policy”  and \\n“unauthorized  use  of  GFE  for  sexually  explicit  or  sexually  oriented  materials.”  The  IT \\nscan  of  Applicant’s  GFE  revealed  that  he  viewed  an  “inappropriate”  online  dating \\nwebsite,  and on one occasion  in  July  2010, he  opened  two  unsolicited  e-mails,  one of \\nwhich  happened  to  contain  photos  of  nude  women,  and  the  other  of  which  contained \\nsomething  that  he  considered  “offensive.”  In  2009  and  2010,  he  engaged  in  long-\\ndistance online and telephone relationships with several women who were foreign-born \\nresidents of various countries. He sent them various sums of money, estimated to be a \\ntotal  in  excess  of  $60,000,  allegedly  earmarked  by  the  recipients  for  transportation, \\nmedical care, support, and release from a customs.  \\n\\nThe  mitigating  evidence  under  the  whole-person  concept  is  more  substantial. \\nApplicant’s alleged behavior occurred over four and one-half years before the SOR was \\nissued, and there is no evidence of subsequent conduct of a similar nature.

       "SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.c,  2.e,  and  2.h  –  three  security  violations  in  a  two-month \\nperiod,  being  returned  from  an  overseas  assignment  without  completing  a \\ncontract,  and  being  placed  on  probation  in  2010.  From  March  to  April  2010, \\nApplicant worked as a security guard for a company [hereafter referred to as “Company \\nA”]  at  an  overseas  location.  In  that  job,  his  duties  included  verifying  the  eligibility  of \\nthose seeking access to controlled spaces and classified information. \\n\\n \\nOn March 1, 2010, a team leader at Company A issued a memorandum for the \\nrecord (MFR) that reflected Applicant closed, but did not lock, a safe in a secured space \\nand failed to record properly the opening and closing of the safe and the logging in and \\nout of classified documents. (Allegation in SOR 1.a). Applicant was counseled to ensure \\nthat  all  procedures  were  followed,  especially  those  concerning  the  safeguarding  of \\nclassified \\ninstances  of  unsatisfactory \\nperformance  would  result  in  more  severe  corrective  action.  The  MFR  reflected  it  was \\nplaced in “personnel file,” but it does not contain Applicant’s signature or any indication \\nthat he was shown it or informed about it.4 \\n\\ninformation,  and  admonished \\n\\nthat \\n\\nfurther \\n\\n \\nApplicant testified that he never willfully violated any security protocol that was \\nproperly  explained  to  him.  This  incident  occurred  soon  after  he  began  working  for \\nCompany A. He arrived at the overseas location less than 48 hours before the incident. \\nIt happened his first day on the job. He claimed that he was not given proper guidance \\non the opening and closing of the safe. The safe was not secure because he failed to \\nspin the lock dial. The safe was located in a secure room and the classified information \\nwas not subject to compromise. Additionally, a person cleared for classified information \\nsigned out a document, but Applicant did not know there was a part of the document \\nthat he was required to fill out. He acknowledged that he made mistakes because he did \\nnot ask enough questions and stated he did not thereafter make those same mistakes \\nagain.5 \\n \\nOn March 10, 2010, a team leader at Company A issued a MFR that reflected \\nApplicant failed to follow orders by permitting a non-cleared worker to have access to \\nthe controlled access area (CAA) without verifying the worker was on the CAA access \\nroster. (Allegation in SOR ¶ 1.b). Applicant was questioned about this security violation \\nand  stated  that  he  recognized  the  worker.  The  MFR  noted  that  the  worker  had  just \\nreturned from a leave of absence and had not yet been placed back on the CAA access \\nroster.  The  MFR  also  indicated  that  it  would  serve  as  a  written  reprimand  of \\nunsatisfactory performance. The MFR reflected it was placed in “personnel file,” but it \\ndoes  not  contain  Applicant’s  signature  or  any  indication  that  he  was  shown  it  or \\ninformed about it.6 \\n                                                           \\n\\n4 GE 2, 3. \\n\\n5 Tr. 13, 21-34, 41; GE 2; Applicant’s Answer to the SOR. \\n\\n6 GE 2, 4.

       "Applicant testified that this was his second day working at a particular post. He \\nstated  that  he  read  the  wrong  weekly  CAA  access  roster  at  the  post  and  the  non-\\ncleared worker was listed on that roster. This was an outdated access roster. Applicant \\nclaimed  that,  due  to  a  clerical  error,  the  individual  was  not  added  to  the  most  recent \\naccess roster. He claimed he recognized the individual as being a person on the access \\nroster from the previous day, but that was the wrong access roster. When the error was \\ndiscovered,  the  old  roster  was  taken  away  and  a  new  roster  was  issued  with  the \\nindividual in question added to it. Applicant stated his team leader  was upset that he \\nhad not checked the latest access roster. He was counseled for this incident, but did not \\nremember receiving a written warning at that time.7 \\n\\n \\nOn  April  19,  2010,  a  team  leader  at  Company  A  issued  a  MFR  that  reflected \\nApplicant failed to conduct properly a page inventory of classified documents on April \\n17,  2010.  (Allegation  in  SOR  ¶  1.c).  The  MFR  noted  that  two  of  the  documents  had \\nbeen  previously  combined  and  another  had  48  pages  removed  for  destruction. \\nApplicant’s  inventory  failed  to  account  for  the  missing  pages.  He  was  asked  how  he \\nconducted the inventory and responded by saying he conducted a page-by-page count. \\nWhen asked to explain the discrepancy involving the missing pages, he acknowledged \\nhis mistake. The MFR reflected it was placed in “personnel file,” but it does not contain \\nApplicant’s signature or any indication that he was shown it or informed about it.8 \\n\\n \\n \\nIn his background interview, Applicant stated that he counted the pages. At the \\nhearing, he testified that every week a  document inventory was conducted and every \\nmonth a more extensive page-by-page document inventory was conducted. He stated \\nthat he made the mistake of believing this inventory was the weekly document inventory \\ninstead  of  the  monthly  page-by-page  inventory.  He  claimed  the  team  leader  had \\nimproperly taken the missing pages and stored them in his room without logging them \\nout.  He  believed  the  team  leader  was  setting  a  trap  for  the  guard  conducting  the \\ninventory.  This  incident  resulted  in  a  conflict  between  him  and  the  team  leader.  He \\ncontacted the program manager and reported that the team leader improperly handled \\ndocuments. He also indicated that he wrote a detailed rebuttal to the counseling.9 \\n \\n \\nShortly after the incident on April 17, 2010, Applicant was sent home before the \\ncompletion  of  his  contract.  A  payroll  document  reflected  “[h]e  is  on  probation.  Please \\nhold  pay.”  (Allegation  in  SOR  ¶  2.e).  He  stated  that  he  received  all  of  the  written \\nwarnings/reprimands when he was leaving this overseas location. He further stated that \\nhe was so upset about being sent home that he did not read the documents that were \\ngiven to him. He did not consider his return to the United States as a termination. His \\nprogram  manager  led  him  believe  that  he  was  sent  back  because  of  the  personality \\n                                                           \\n\\n7 Tr. 34-42; GE 2; Applicant’s Answer to the SOR. \\n\\n8 GE 2, 5.

On January 9, \\n \\n2009, Applicant was issued a summons to appear in court for the charge of assault on a \\nfamily member, a Class 1 misdemeanor. On April 28, 2009, Applicant pleaded not guilty \\nto the charge. The court found there were sufficient facts to establish guilt but deferred \\nadjudication  for  one  year.

In April 2011, the charge was dismissed.11 \\n \\n \\nIn  his  e-QIP,  Applicant  disclosed  this  charge.  He  testified  that  his  ex-wife  was \\nstriking him during an argument. He tried to block her hands but accidently hit her on \\nthe side of the head with an open hand. He testified that he never hit his ex-wife before \\nor after that incident.12 \\n \\n\\nSOR ¶ 2.b – termination from a job during a probationary period in March \\n2009.  In  his  e-QIP,  Applicant  disclosed  that  he  was  terminated  from  a  security  guard \\nposition with Company B near the end of a six-month probationary period. Company B \\nwas  not  required  to  provide  an  explanation  for  the  termination  during  that  period.  He \\nnoted that he was accused of wearing an earbud linked to an unauthorized MP3 player \\nwhile at work. He stated the earbud was for a cell phone that was permitted. He also \\nindicated  that  this  incident  happened  about  a  month  before  his  probationary  period \\nended, and he was never written up for this incident.13  \\n\\n \\nApplicant testified that he believed that he was terminated from the probationary \\nposition because of the pending domestic-violence charge. If he was convicted of the \\ncharge, he would have been prohibited from carrying a firearm at work. If he continued \\nto  work  for  Company  B  beyond  the  probationary  period,  he  would  have  become  a \\nmember of the employee’s union and the company would have had to hire an attorney \\nto  remove  him  from  the  job  if  he  could  no  longer  carry  a  firearm.

Usually the guards would rotate between the posts each night. On the night in \\nquestion, however, the schedule did not rotate the guards between the posts. Applicant \\nand  the  other  guard  assumed  their  assignments  were  rotated  and  stood  them  in  that \\nmanner. In doing so, they signed the logs for the wrong posts. He claimed no dereliction \\nof duty occurred because both posts were properly manned. The other guard also was \\nwritten up for this discrepancy.16 \\n\\n \\nSOR ¶ 2.d – illegally gained access to hotel by opening a sliding door in \\n2009. While working for Company C overseas from July to December 2009, Applicant \\nresided in a hotel. The hotel was connected to a mall. There was a sliding door from the \\nmall  to  the  hotel.  After  a  certain  time  each  night,  the  door  was  secured.  On  two \\noccasions, Applicant went through the sliding door after it was secured. He claimed that \\nhe was given permission from the guard in the mall to use the door on both occasions. \\nAfter the second occasion, the hotel management was upset and threatened to kick out \\nall of the U.S. contractors from the hotel. Company C agreed to send Applicant back to \\nthe United States to appease the hotel. He acknowledged that he was given a written \\nwarning because of this incident. He also stated that he did not consider it a termination \\nbecause he was told it was not his fault and the company would find him another job. \\nHe met with a company representative for another job opportunity overseas, but soon \\nthereafter his father passed away and his mother was in the hospital, which precluded \\nhim  from  taking  that  job.  In  his  e-QIP,  he  did  not  list  the  reason  for  termination  of \\nemployment with Company C.

       "The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \\naccess  to  classified  information.  This  relationship  transcends  normal  duty  hours  and \\nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \\npossible  risk  that  the  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  safeguard \\nclassified  information.  Such  decisions  entail  a  certain  degree  of  legally  permissible \\nextrapolation  of  potential,  rather  than  actual,  risk  of  compromise  of  classified \\ninformation. Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in \\nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. \\nOr.  10865  §  7.  See  also  Executive  Order  12968  (Aug.  2,  1995),  Section  3.  Thus,  a \\nclearance  decision  is  merely  an  indication  that  the  Applicant  has  or  has  not  met  the \\nstrict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing \\na clearance. \\n\\n \\nInitially,  the  Government  must  establish,  by  substantial  evidence,  conditions  in \\nthe  personal  or  professional  history  of  the  applicant  that  may  disqualify  the  applicant \\nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \\nof  establishing  controverted  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR.

AG ¶¶ 34(g) and 34(h) apply. \\n \\n \\n¶ 35: \\n \\n\\nThere are three handling of protected information mitigating conditions under AG \\n\\n(a)  so  much  time  has  elapsed  since  the  behavior,  or  it  happened  so \\ninfrequently  or  under  such  unusual  circumstances,  that  it  is  unlikely  to \\nrecur  and  does  not  cast  doubt  on \\nreliability, \\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;  \\n \\n(b) the individual responded favorably to counseling or remedial security \\ntraining and now demonstrates a positive attitude toward the discharge of \\nsecurity responsibilities; and \\n \\n(c)  the security violations were due to improper or inadequate training. \\n\\nindividual’s \\n\\nthe \\n\\n \\n \\nAs  the  Appeal  Board  has  stated,  once  it  is  established  that  an  applicant  has \\ncommitted security violations, he or she has a “very heavy burden” of persuasion as to \\nmitigation.  Such  violations  “strike  at  the  heart  of  the  industrial  security  program.” \\nAccordingly,  a  judge  must  give  any  claims  of  reform  or  rehabilitation  “strict  scrutiny.” \\nISCR Case No. 11-09219 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 31, 2014).   \\n \\n \\nThe conduct in question happened over six years ago. While Applicant has not \\ncommitted any other security violation since then, this conduct should not be considered \\nin  isolation,  but  should  be  examined  in  relation  to  his  other  questionable  conduct  as \\nalleged under Guideline E. When viewed in  that manner, I am unable to find that his \\nconduct  happened  so  long  ago,  was  so  infrequent,  or  occurred  under  unusual \\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur. In reaching this conclusion, I also considered \\nthat the security violations happened shortly after he started a new job and he claimed \\nhe had not received adequate training. Nevertheless, I find that his security violations \\ncontinue  to  cast  doubt  on  his  reliability,  trustworthiness,  and  good  judgment.  None  of \\nthe mitigating conditions fully apply.  \\n \\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \\n \\n\\n \\n\\nAG ¶ 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct:  \\n \\n\\n \\n10 \\n \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "Conduct  involving  questionable  judgment,  lack  of  candor,  dishonesty,  or \\nunwillingness  to  comply  with  rules  and  regulations  can  raise  questions \\nabout  an  individual's  reliability,  trustworthiness  and  ability  to  protect \\nclassified information. \\n \\nAG  ¶  16  describes  conditions  that  could  raise  security  concerns  and  may  be \\n\\ndisqualifying in this case:  \\n\\n \\n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \\nany  personnel  security  questionnaire,  personal  history  statement,  or \\nsimilar  form  used  to  conduct  investigations,  determine  employment \\nqualifications,  award  benefits  or  status,  determine  security  eligibility  or \\ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;  \\n \\n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \\nnot  sufficient  for  an  adverse  determination  under  any  other  single \\nguideline,  but  which,  when  considered  as  a  whole,  supports  a  whole-\\nperson  assessment  of  questionable \\njudgment,  untrustworthiness, \\nunreliability,  lack  of  candor,  unwillingness  to  comply  with  rules  and \\nregulations,  or  other  characteristics  indicating  that  the  person  may  not \\nproperly safeguard protected information; and \\n \\n(d)  credible  adverse  information  that  is  not  explicitly  covered  under  any \\nother  guideline  and  may  not  be  sufficient  by  itself  for  an  adverse \\ndetermination,  but  which,  when  combined  with  all  available  evidence \\ninformation  supports  a  whole-person  assessment  of  questionable \\njudgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to \\ncomply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that \\nthe  person  may  not  properly  safeguard  protected  information.  This \\nincludes  but  is  not  limited  to  consideration  of:  (1)  untrustworthy  or \\nunreliable behavior. . . ; (3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; (4) \\nevidence of significant misuse of Government or other employer’s time or \\nresources. \\n \\nI  did  not  find  Applicant’s  testimony  convincing  that  he  forgot  about  the  written \\nwarnings he received for the security violations in 2010 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.c), or the written \\ncounseling he received for dereliction of duty and falsification of a document in 2009. \\nThe security violations happened about six month before he submitted his e-QIP. Due \\nto  those  security  violations,  he  was  sent  home  from  an  overseas  location,  placed  on \\nprobation, and was not employed for the intervening six months. It is not believable that \\nhe would have forgotten about those recent events when he submitted his e-QIP at the \\nstart of his next job. His claim that he did not have the records or written warnings with \\nhim  when  he  submitted  the  e-QIP  is  likewise  not  persuasive.  I  find  that  Applicant \\ndeliberately falsified his 2010 e-QIP when he failed to disclose those written warnings \\nand counseling. AG ¶ 16(a) applies.  \\n\\n \\n11 \\n \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "Applicant  was  charged  with  a  domestic  assault  in  2009,  terminated  from  a \\nprobationary  job  in  2009,  counseled  for  misconduct  at  the  work  place  in  2009, \\nterminated  from  employment  due  to  misconduct  in  2009,  and  committed  multiple \\nsecurity  violations  that  resulted  in  his  early  return  from  an  overseas  assignment  and \\nemployment probation in 2010. Viewed in its entirety, his conduct reflects a pattern of \\nunreliability, untrustworthiness, and poor judgment. AG ¶¶16(c) and 16(d) apply.  \\n\\n \\nFive  personal  conduct  mitigation  conditions  under  AG  ¶  17  are  potentially \\n\\napplicable: \\n\\n \\n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \\nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \\n \\n(b)  the  refusal  or  failure  to  cooperate,  omission,  or  concealment  was \\ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \\nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \\nspecifically concerning the security clearance process.

He  denied  the  falsifications  in  his  Answer  to  the  SOR  and  at  the  hearing, \\nwhich shows that he has not reformed and rehabilitated himself.  All of his misconduct \\nmust be viewed in its entirety. From the evidence presented, I am unable to find that his \\nquestionable  conduct  happened  so  long  ago,  was  so  infrequent,  or  occurred  under \\nunique  circumstances  that  it  is  unlikely  to  recur.

The  action  was  taken  under  Executive  Order  10865,  Safeguarding \\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \\nDefense  Directive  5220.6,  Defense  Industrial  Personnel  Security  Clearance  Review \\nProgram  (January  2,  1992),  as  amended  (Directive);  and  the  adjudicative  guidelines \\n(AG) effective within the Department of Defense after September 1, 2006.  \\n\\n  \\nOn July 11, 2014, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a decision on the \\n \\nrecord. Department Counsel issued a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on July 7, 2015.  \\nApplicant received the FORM on  August 14, 2015. He had 30 days from his receipt of \\nthe  FORM  to  submit  additional  information  in  response  to  the  FORM.  Applicant \\nrequested  an  extension  until  October  19,  2015,  to  submit  matters  in  response  to  the \\nFORM. His Response to the FORM and attached documents are admitted as Item  12. \\nDepartment  Counsel  had  no  objection  to  Applicant’s  Response  to the  Form.  (Item  13) \\nOn November 5, 2015, the FORM was forwarded to the Hearing Office and assigned to \\nme  on  November  9,  2015.  Based  upon  a  review  of  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and \\ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \\n\\n \\n1 \\n \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "Findings of Fact \\n\\n \\n\\nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admits to all SOR allegations.  (Item 2)    \\n\\n \\n \\n \\nApplicant  is  a  43-year-old  employee  of  a  DOD  contractor  seeking  to  obtain  a \\nsecurity clearance. He has worked for his current employer since July 2011. Previously, \\nhe owned his own construction company from October 2007 to July 2011. He has been \\nmarried and divorced twice. He is currently married to his third wife and has a five-year-\\nold son and a three-year-old daughter. He also has a stepson. (Item 3; Item 12)   \\n\\n \\nOn  July  20,  2011,  Applicant  submitted  an  electronic  questionnaire \\n\\nfor \\ninvestigation  processing  (e-QIP).  (Item  3)  A  subsequent  background  investigation \\nrevealed  Applicant  encountered \\nfinancial  problems.  Specifically,  Applicant  was \\napproximately $95,326 past due on a mortgage (SOR ¶ 1.a: Item 6 at 2; Item 7 at 2); he \\nowed a $654 judgement entered against him in November 2009 on behalf of a hospital \\n(SOR  ¶  1.b:  Item  6  at  1;  Item  7  at  1;  Item  9  at  1);  and  he  filed  for  bankruptcy  under \\nChapter  7  in  June  2010.  The  Chapter  7  bankruptcy  was  converted  to  a  Chapter  13 \\nbankruptcy. (SOR ¶ 1.c: Item 5 at 1; Item 6 at 1; Item 7 at 1; Item 10).   \\n\\n \\nIn  his  response  to  the  SOR,  dated  December  11,  2014,  Applicant  admits  to  all \\nallegations,  but  claims  the  debts  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.b  are  included  in  his \\nbankruptcy.    The  Chapter  13  bankruptcy  repayment  plan  required  him  to  pay  $164 \\npayments over a period of 60 months. Applicant indicated he is timely making payments \\nand will continue to do so until the plan is complete in August 2015. (Item 2 at 6)  \\n\\n \\nIn a response to Interrogatories, dated July 15, 2013, Applicant indicated that he \\nfiled for bankruptcy because of his divorce from his second wife in 2009 and as a result \\nof business deal that went bad. He built seven houses for a contractor and was never \\npaid.  He  believes  one  of  the  creditors  (a  mortgage)  included  in  his  bankruptcy  is  the \\nsame as the mortgage alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a. (Item 4 at 9)  \\n\\n \\nApplicant  received  financial  counseling  as  a  requirement  of  his  bankruptcy \\nprocess.  (Item  4  at  13,  25-29)  In  July  2013,  he  also  completed  a  personal  financial \\nworksheet.  His  net  monthly  income  was  $2,851.  He  had  $2,297  in  total  monthly \\nexpenses. After expenses, he had $554 left over in discretionary income. (Item 4 at 22)  \\n\\n \\nIn his response to the FORM, Applicant provided all of his Chapter 13 bankruptcy \\npaperwork. He completed his payment plan and the Chapter 13 bankruptcy is complete. \\nHe  provided  a  copy  of  the  Discharge  of  Debtor  After  Completion  of  Chapter  13  Plan, \\ndated  September  28,  2015.  He  provided  a  copy  of  his  payment  history.  He  also \\nprovided a portion of a TransUnion credit report which indicates the debt alleged in SOR \\n¶  1.b  was  included  in  the  Chapter  13  bankruptcy.  He  is  still  not  sure  where  the \\nmortgage debt came from. It is no longer on his credit report and his attorney assures \\nhim that it was included in the bankruptcy. (Item 12)    \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n2 \\n \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "He said he has made his share of mistakes, but has done everything he could to \\nrectify  the  situation.    Everything  he  does  is  motivated  by  making  his  children’s  lives \\nbetter.  He  explained  he  became  bankrupt  as  a  result  of  his  previous  job  in  the \\nconstruction  business.  Applicant  built  houses.  His  business  partners  backed  out  when \\nthe real estate business slowed down and left Applicant with thousands of unpaid bills. \\nAt  the  same  time,  his  ex-wife  incurred  some  bills  that  he  could  not  afford  to  repay. \\nApplicant is now able to pay his bills. His pay has increased an additional $8 an hour. \\n(Item 12) \\n   \\n\\nPolicies \\n\\n \\n\\nWhen  evaluating  an  applicant’s  suitability \\n\\n \\nthe \\nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \\nintroductory  explanations  for  each  guideline,  the  adjudicative  guidelines  list  potentially \\ndisqualifying  conditions  and  mitigating  conditions,  which  must  be  considered  when \\ndetermining an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. \\n\\nfor  a  security  clearance, \\n\\n \\nThese  guidelines  are  not  inflexible  rules  of  law.  Instead,  recognizing  the \\ncomplexities  of  human  behavior,  these  guidelines  are  applied  in  conjunction  with  the \\nfactors  listed  in  the  adjudicative  process.  The  administrative  judge’s  overarching \\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 2(c), \\nthe  entire  process  is  a  conscientious  scrutiny  of  a  number  of  variables  known  as  the \\n“whole-person  concept.”  The  administrative  judge  must  consider  all  available,  reliable \\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \\ndecision. \\n\\n \\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) \\nrequires  that  “[a]ny  doubt  concerning  personnel  being  considered  for  access  to \\nclassified  information  will  be  resolved  in  favor  of  national  security.”  In  reaching  this \\ndecision,  I  have  drawn  only  those  conclusions  that  are  reasonable,  logical,  and  based \\non the evidence contained in the record.  \\n\\n \\nUnder  Directive  ¶  E3.1.14,  the  Government  must  present  evidence  to  establish \\ncontroverted  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  Under  Directive  ¶  E3.1.15,  the  applicant  is \\nresponsible  for  presenting  “witnesses  and  other  evidence  to  rebut,  explain,  extenuate, \\nor  mitigate  facts  admitted  by  applicant  or  proven  by  Department  Counsel.  .  .  .”  The \\napplicant  has  the  ultimate  burden  of  persuasion  as  to  obtaining  a  favorable  security \\ndecision.  \\n\\nthe  Government  predicated  upon \\n\\n \\nA  person  who  seeks  access  to  classified  information  enters  into  a  fiduciary \\nrelationship  with \\ntrust  and  confidence.  This \\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \\nGovernment  reposes  a  high  degree  of  trust  and  confidence  in  individuals  to  whom  it \\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \\nthe  possible  risk  the  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  protect  or \\nsafeguard  classified  information.  Such  decisions  entail  a  certain  degree  of  legally \\n\\n \\n3 \\n \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "permissible  extrapolation  as  to  potential,  rather  than  actual,  risk  of  compromise  of \\nclassified information. \\n\\n  \\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of \\nthe  national  interest  and  shall  in  no  sense  be  a  determination  as  to  the  loyalty  of  the \\napplicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \\n \\n\\n \\n\\nAnalysis \\n\\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \\n\\nout in AG & 18:       \\n \\n\\nFailure  or  inability  to  live  within  one=s  means,  satisfy  debts,  and  meet \\nfinancial  obligations  may  indicate  poor  self-control,  lack  of  judgment,  or \\nunwillingness  to  abide  by  rules  and  regulations,  all  of  which  can  raise \\nquestions  about  an  individual=s  reliability,  trustworthiness  and  ability  to \\nprotect  classified \\nfinancially \\noverextended  is  at  risk  of  having  to  engage  in  illegal  acts  to  generate \\nfunds.  \\n\\ninformation.  An \\n\\nindividual  who \\n\\nis \\n\\n \\n\\nThe  guideline  notes  several  disqualifying  conditions  that  could  raise  security \\nconcerns. I find AG &19(a) (an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); and AG &19(c) \\n(a  history  of  not  meeting  financial  obligations)  apply  to  Applicant’s  case.  Applicant \\nencountered  financial  problems  since  2008,  which  resulted  in  a  bankruptcy  filing  in \\n2010.   \\n \\nAn  individual  who  is  financially  irresponsible  may  also  be  irresponsible, \\nunconcerned, or careless in their obligations to protect classified information. Behaving \\nirresponsibly in one aspect of life provides an indication of how a person may behave in \\nother  aspects  of  life.  A  person’s  relationship  with  his  creditors  is  a  private  matter  until \\nevidence  is  uncovered  demonstrating  an  inability  or  unwillingness  to  pay  debts  under \\nagreed  terms.  Absent  evidence  of  strong  extenuating  or  mitigating  circumstances,  an \\napplicant with a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk \\ninconsistent with the holding of a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be \\ndebt free, but is required to manage his finances in such a way as to meet his financial \\nobligations.  \\n\\n \\nThe  Government’s  substantial  evidence  and  Applicant’s  own  admissions  raise \\nsecurity  concerns  under  Guideline  F.  The  burden  shifted  to  Applicant  to  produce \\nevidence  to  rebut,  explain,  extenuate,  or  mitigate  the  security  concerns.  (Directive \\n¶E3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden \\nof  disproving  it  never  shifts  to  the  Government.  (See  ISCR  Case  No.  02-31154  at  5 \\n(App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005))  \\n\\n \\n4 \\n \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "The  guideline  also  includes  examples  of  conditions  that  could  mitigate  security \\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions potentially \\napply:  \\n \\nAG  &  20(a)  (the  behavior  happened  so  long  ago,  was  so  infrequent,  or \\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \\ncast  doubt  on  the  individual’s  current  reliability,  trustworthiness,  or  good \\njudgment);  \\n \\nAG  &  20(b)  (the  conditions  that  resulted  in  the  financial  problem  were \\nlargely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \\ndownturn,  unexpected  medical  emergency,  or  a  death,  divorce  or \\nseparation),  and \\nthe \\ncircumstances);  \\n \\nAG  ¶  20(c)  (the  person  has  received  or  is  receiving  counseling  for  the \\nproblem  and/or  there  are  clear  indications  that  the  problem  is  being \\nresolved or is under control);  \\n\\nresponsibly  under \\n\\nthe \\n\\nindividual  acted \\n\\n  \\n\\nAG  &  20(d)  (the  individual  initiated  a  good-faith  effort  to  repay  overdue \\ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts); and   \\n\\n \\n\\nAG &20(e) (the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \\nof  the  past-due  debt  which  is  the  cause  of  the  problem  and  provides \\ndocumented  proof  to  substantiate  the  basis  of  the  dispute  or  provides \\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue). \\n \\nApplicant’s  financial  problems  were  caused  by  a  business  downturn  and \\nexpenses  related  to  his  divorce  from  his  second  wife  in  2009.  His  business  partners \\nbroke their agreements with Applicant during the real estate downturn, leaving Applicant \\nwith thousands of unpaid bills. He attempted to resolve the situation on his own until he \\ndetermined  he  had  no  option  other  than  bankruptcy.  He  successfully  completed  his \\npayment plan under Chapter 13 and his debts were discharged in September 2015. His \\nsalary  has  increased  an  additional  $8  per  hour  and  he  is  able  to  pay  his  bills.  His \\nfinancial  problems  are  unlikely  to  recur  and  no  longer  cast  doubt  on  his  reliability, \\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. AG ¶¶ 20(a) and 20(b) apply.  \\n\\n \\nAG & 20(c) applies. Applicant was required to attend financial counseling as part \\nof  his  bankruptcy.    He  completed  financial  counseling  as  well  as  the  terms  of  his \\nChapter 13 repayment plan. Applicant’s financial situation is now under control.  \\n\\n \\nAG & 20(d) applies because Applicant demonstrated he made a good-faith effort \\ntowards  resolving  his  delinquent  accounts.    He  completed  his  Chapter  13  repayment \\nplan.  All  payments  were  made  on  a  timely  basis.    AG  &  20(e)  is  applicable  because \\nApplicant disputed the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b, claiming they were part of \\n\\n \\n5 \\n \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "his  bankruptcy.  The  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.b  was  verified  to  be  a  part  of  his \\nbankruptcy. The mortgage debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a is no longer on his credit report.  \\n\\n \\nApplicant  resolved  any  doubts  raised  by  his  financial  situation.  He  successfully  \\n\\ndemonstrated that his financial situation is under control.  \\n \\nWhole-Person Concept \\n \\n \\nUnder  the  whole-person  concept,  the  administrative  judge  must  evaluate  an \\napplicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s \\nconduct  and  all  the  circumstances.  The  administrative  judge  should  consider  the  nine \\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  \\n \\n\\nthe  conduct, \\n\\nis  voluntary;  (6) \\n\\nthe  nature,  extent,  and  seriousness  of \\nto \\n\\nthe  conduct;  (2) \\nthe \\n(1) \\ninclude  knowledgeable \\ncircumstances  surrounding \\nparticipation;  (3)  the  frequency  and  recency  of  the  conduct;  (4)  the \\nindividual’s  age  and maturity  at  the  time  of the  conduct;  (5)  the  extent to \\nwhich  participation \\nthe  presence  or  absence  of \\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \\nfor  the  conduct;  (8)  the  potential  for  pressure,  coercion,  exploitation,  or \\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \\n \\n \\nUnder  AG  ¶  2(c),  the  ultimate  determination  of  whether  to  grant  eligibility  for  a \\nsecurity  clearance  must  be  an  overall  commonsense  judgment  based  upon  careful \\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \\n        \\n\\nI  considered  the  potentially  disqualifying  and  mitigating  conditions  in  light  of  all \\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered several circumstances \\nbeyond  Applicant’s  control  adversely  affected  his  finances,  including  divorce  and  the \\nreal estate downturn that adversely affected his construction business. He successfully \\ncompleted  his  Chapter  13  repayment  plan  and  his  financial  situation  has  stabilized. \\nApplicant mitigated the security concerns raised under financial considerations.  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \\n\\n \\n\\nFormal Findings \\n\\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \\n\\nSubparagraphs 1.a – 1.c:   \\n\\nFor Applicant \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nFOR APPLICANT \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n6 \\n \\n \\n\\n\n",

He has a history of \\nfinancial  delinquencies,  including  delinquent  debts  owed  to  eight  creditors  in  the \\napproximate  amount  of  $37,847.  While  Applicant  has  either  resolved  or  is  making \\npayments  on  five  of  his  debts,  he  failed  to  establish  that  three  others  are  being \\naddressed. Applicant has  not mitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns \\nbecause he has failed to show he  acted responsibly with respect to  these outstanding \\ndebts. He mitigated the Foreign Influence security concerns created by his mother, two \\nsisters, and three brothers, who are all citizens and residents of Vietnam. Eligibility for \\naccess to classified information is denied.  \\n \\n\\nStatement of the Case \\n\\n \\n\\nOn  December  5,  2014,  the  Defense  Office  of  Hearings  and  Appeals  (DOHA) \\nissued  a  Statement  of  Reasons  (SOR)  to  Applicant  detailing  security  concerns  under \\nGuideline  F,  Financial  Considerations  and  Guideline  B,  Foreign  Influence.  The  action \\nwas  taken  under  Executive  Order  (EO)  10865,  Safeguarding  Classified  Information \\nwithin  Industry  (February  20,  1960),  as  amended;  Department  of  Defense  Directive \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n1 \\n\\n\n",
       "5220.6,  Defense  Industrial  Personnel  Security  Clearance  Review Program  (January  2, \\n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective for cases \\nafter September 1, 2006. (Item 1.) \\n\\n \\nApplicant responded to the SOR (Answer) on January 11, 2015 and February 2, \\n \\n2015. (Item 1.) He requested that his case be decided by an administrative judge on the \\nwritten  record.  Department  Counsel  submitted  the  Government’s  written  case  on  April \\n21,  2016.  A  complete  copy  of  the  File  of  Relevant  Material  (FORM),  containing  five \\nItems, was received by Applicant on April 27, 2016. He was afforded an opportunity to \\nfile objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation within 30 days \\nof  his  receipt of  the  FORM.  Applicant  submitted documents  marked  Applicant  Exhibits \\n(AE) A through K in response to the FORM within the 30-day period that ended May 27, \\n2016.  Department  Counsel  had  no  objection  to  AE  A  through  AE  K,  and  they  are \\nadmitted into the record. DOHA assigned the case to me on December 13, 2016.  \\n \\n\\nProcedural Rulings \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nIn  the  FORM,  the  Government  requested  I  take  administrative  notice  of  certain \\nfacts  relating  to  Vietnam.  Department  Counsel  provided  a  five-page  summary  of  the \\nfacts,  supported  by  five  Government  documents  pertaining  to  Vietnam,  identified  as \\nItem  6.  The  documents  provide  elaboration  and  context  for  the  summary.  I  take \\nadministrative  notice  of  the  facts  included  in  the  U.S.  Government  reports.  They  are \\nlimited to matters of general knowledge, not subject to reasonable dispute. They are set \\nout in the Findings of Fact. \\n\\n \\n\\nFindings of Fact \\n\\n \\n \\nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations in subparagraphs 2.a and 2.b. He failed \\nto explicitly admit or deny SOR subparagraph 1.a through 1.h, and as a result, they will \\nbe treated as denials. (Item 1.) After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, and \\nexhibits, I make the following findings of fact. \\n \\n \\nApplicant is 51 years old. He was born in Vietnam and immigrated to the United \\nStates. He attended a U.S. high school. He became a U.S. citizen in 1981.  He earned \\nan  associate’s  degree  in  1984  from  a  U.S.  college.  He  was  employed  by  a  federal \\ncontractor from February 2011 until he was laid off in February 2013. He is married to a \\nU.S. citizen, and has two children who are U. S. citizens. (Item 2.) \\n \\n \\napproximate amount of $37,847. His debts are as follows. \\n \\n \\nApplicant  is  delinquent  on  his  $257,199  primary  mortgage  in  the  amount  of \\n$10,420,  as  alleged  in  SOR  subparagraph  1.a.  He  presented  documentation  showing \\nhe made payments of $2,085 to this creditor on December 26, 2014, January 20, 2015, \\nand  May  14,  2016.  He  indicated  in  a  letter  that  he  was  trying  to  bring  this  account \\ncurrent. However, he failed to establish a regular payment history and document that he \\nbrought this debt current. It remains unresolved. (Item 1; AE A; AE B.) \\n\\nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleges Applicant is indebted to eight creditors in the \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n2 \\n\\n\n",
       "Applicant  was  delinquent  on  a  $17,986  second  mortgage  in  the  amount  of \\n \\n$2,295, as  alleged  in SOR  subparagraph 1.b.  He  presented a  letter  from this  creditor, \\ndated March 15, 2015, which reflected this debt was paid in full on March 11, 2016. It is \\nresolved. (Item 1; AE C.) \\n \\n \\nApplicant was indebted on a charged-off credit card in the amount of $20,632, as \\nalleged in SOR subparagraph 1.c. He presented a letter from this creditor, dated March \\n9, 2013, which reflected this debt was paid in full. It is resolved. (Item 1; AE D.) \\n \\n \\nApplicant was delinquent on an $11,935  vehicle loan in the amount of $618, as \\nalleged in SOR subparagraph 1.d. Applicant presented a copy of a receipt for a check in \\nthe  amount  of  $710,  dated  April  29,  2016,  and  an  account  statement  that  shows \\nApplicant’s loan was current as of March 30, 2016, with an unpaid balance of $7,422.50 \\nremaining on the loan. Applicant is current on this debt. (Item 1; AE E; AE F.)  \\n \\n \\nApplicant  is  indebted  on  a  charged-off  account  in  the  amount  of  $2,654,  as \\nalleged in SOR subparagraph 1.e. He produced a written payment agreement with this \\ncreditor,  which  shows  he  agreed  to  make  monthly  payments  of  $100.  He  produced \\ndocumentation that shows he made one $100 payment on May 14, 2016.  This debt is \\nbeing resolved. (AE H.) \\n \\n \\nApplicant is indebted on a charged-off account in the amount of $530, as alleged \\nin SOR subparagraph 1.f. Applicant produced no documentation that corresponds with \\nthis account. It is unresolved. (Item 5.) \\n \\nApplicant is indebted on a charged-off account in the amount of $409, as alleged \\n \\nin  SOR  subparagraph  1.g.  Applicant  produced  a  letter  from  a  collection  agent  on  this \\naccount, which offered to settle this debt for a payment of $229.06. He failed to produce \\ndocumentation  to  show  he  made  any  payments  to  the  creditor  under  this  agreement. \\n(AE K.)  \\n \\n \\nApplicant  was  indebted  on  a  charged-off  account  in  the  amount  of  $289,  as \\nalleged  in  SOR  subparagraph  1.h.  Applicant  presented  a  receipt  dated  May  20,  2016, \\nwhich shows Applicant paid this debt. It is resolved. (AE J.) \\n \\n \\nApplicant  attributed  his  delinquencies  to  a  reduction  of  hours  at  his  previous \\nemployer, his wife’s unemployment, and his current unemployment. He also noted that \\nhe was aiding his daughter with her university expenses. (AE A.) Applicant provided no \\nrecent household budget showing monthly household expenses, although an April 2013 \\npersonal financial statement showed his expenses exceeded his income by more than \\n$1,000 per month. (Item 3.) He did not provide a copy of his current earnings statement. \\nWithout updated information, I am unable to assess his current financial status, and his \\nability  or  willingness  to  repay  his  remaining  delinquent  debt  and  avoid  future \\ndelinquencies. The record lacks any evidence of credit or financial counseling.  \\n \\n \\nUnder  Guideline  B,  the  SOR  alleges  Applicant’s  mother,  two  sisters,  and  three \\nbrothers  are  citizens  and  residents  of  Vietnam.  Applicant’s  mother  is  unemployed.  He \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n3 \\n\\n\n",
       "communicates  with  her  on  a  monthly  basis  by  phone  and  sees  her  yearly,  when  she \\nvisits  the  United  States.  One  of  Applicant’s  sisters  is  a  waitress,  and  the  other  is  a \\nconstruction  helper.  Applicant’s  brothers  are  unemployed.  Applicant  has  not  seen  his \\nsiblings  in  person  since  1997.  He  communicates  with  them  approximately  once  per \\nmonth.  None  of  his  relatives  in  Vietnam  is  employed  by  the  Vietnamese  government. \\nHis family members in Vietnam are not aware he has applied for a security clearance. \\n(Item 3.)  \\n \\n \\nVietnam is an authoritarian state ruled by the Communist Party of Vietnam. The \\nVietnamese Government arbitrarily arrests and detains individuals for political activities. \\nThe  Government  limits  freedom  of  speech,  religion,  and  the  press.  U.S.  citizens  have \\nbeen detained after traveling in the area of closed borders with China, Cambodia, and \\nLaos.  By  Vietnamese  law,  anyone  born  to  at  least  one  Vietnamese-citizen  parent  is \\nconsidered to be a Vietnamese citizen. (Item 6.) \\n \\n\\nPolicies \\n\\n \\n\\nWhen  evaluating  an  applicant’s  suitability \\n\\n \\nthe \\nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \\nintroductory  explanations  for  each  guideline,  the  adjudicative  guidelines  list  potentially \\ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \\napplicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. \\n \\n\\nfor  a  security  clearance, \\n\\nThese  guidelines  are  not  inflexible  rules  of  law.  Instead,  recognizing  the \\ncomplexities  of  human  behavior,  administrative  judges  apply  the  guidelines  in \\nconjunction with the factors listed in AG ¶ 2(a), describing the adjudicative process. The \\nadministrative \\nimpartial,  and \\ncommonsense  decision.  According  to  AG  ¶ 2(c),  the  entire  process  is  a  conscientious \\nscrutiny  of  a  number  of  variables  known  as  the  “whole-person  concept.”  The \\nadministrative  judge  must  consider  all  available,  reliable  information  about  the  person, \\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \\n\\njudge’s  overarching  adjudicative  goal \\n\\nis  a \\n\\nfair, \\n\\n \\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) \\nrequires  that  “[a]ny  doubt  concerning  personnel  being  considered  for  access  to \\nclassified  information  will  be  resolved  in  favor  of  national  security.”  In  reaching  this \\ndecision,  I  have  drawn  only  those  conclusions  that  are  reasonable,  logical,  and  based \\non the evidence contained in the record.  \\n\\n \\nUnder  Directive  ¶  E3.1.14,  the  Government  must  present  evidence  to  establish \\ncontroverted  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  Under  Directive  ¶  E3.1.15,  the  applicant  is \\nresponsible  for  presenting  “witnesses  and  other  evidence  to  rebut,  explain,  extenuate, \\nor  mitigate  facts  admitted  by  the  applicant  or  proven  by  Department  Counsel.”  The \\napplicant  has  the  ultimate  burden  of  persuasion  to  obtain  a  favorable  clearance \\ndecision.  \\n\\n \\nA  person  who  seeks  access  to  classified  information  enters  into  a  fiduciary \\ntrust  and  confidence.  This \\n\\nthe  Government  predicated  upon \\n\\n \\nrelationship  with \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n4 \\n\\n\n",
       "relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \\nGovernment  reposes  a  high  degree  of  trust  and  confidence  in  individuals  to  whom  it \\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \\nthe  possible  risk  the  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  protect  or \\nsafeguard  classified  information.  Such  decisions  entail  a  certain  degree  of  legally \\npermissible  extrapolation  as  to  potential,  rather  than  actual,  risk  of  compromise  of \\nclassified information. \\n \\n\\nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be “in terms of the \\nnational  interest  and  shall  in  no  sense  be  a  determination  as  to  the  loyalty  of  the \\napplicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \\n \\n\\nAnalysis \\n\\nThe  security  concern  for  Financial  Considerations  is  set  out  in  AG  ¶  18,  as \\n\\nfollows:       \\n \\n\\nFailure  or  inability  to  live  within  one’s  means,  satisfy  debts,  and  meet \\nfinancial  obligations  may  indicate  poor  self-control,  lack  of  judgment,  or \\nunwillingness  to  abide  by  rules  and  regulations,  all  of  which  can  raise \\nquestions  about  an  individual’s  reliability,  trustworthiness  and  ability  to \\nprotect  classified \\nfinancially \\noverextended  is  at  risk  of  having  to  engage  in  illegal  acts  to  generate \\nfunds.  \\n \\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise a security concern under \\n\\ninformation.  An \\n\\nindividual  who \\n\\nis \\n\\nAG ¶ 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \\n \\n\\n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \\n \\n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \\n\\n \\n \\nApplicant  had  a  history  of  financial  delinquencies  that  he  had  been  unable  to \\nresolve,  including  delinquent  debts  to  eight  creditors  in  the  approximate  amount  of \\n$37,847,  as  alleged  in  the  SOR.  The  Government  established  the  disqualifying \\nconditions in AG ¶ 19(a) and 19(c). Further inquiry about the applicability of mitigating \\nconditions is required.  \\n \\n \\napplicable:  \\n\\nFive Financial Considerations mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially \\n\\n \\n(a)  the  behavior  happened  so  long  ago,  was  so  infrequent,  or  occurred \\nunder  such  circumstances  that  it  is  unlikely  to  recur  and  does  not  cast \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n5 \\n\\n\n",
       "is \\n\\nthe  cause  of \\n\\ndoubt  on  the  individual’s  current  reliability,  trustworthiness,  or  good \\njudgment; \\n \\n(b)  the  conditions  that  resulted  in  the  financial  problem  were  largely \\nbeyond  the  person’s  control  (e.g.,  loss  of  employment,  a  business \\ndownturn,  unexpected  medical  emergency,  or  a  death,  divorce  or \\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \\n \\n(c)  the  person  has  received  or  is  receiving  counseling  for  the  problem \\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \\nunder control;  \\n \\n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \\notherwise resolve debts; and \\n \\n(e)  the  individual  has  a  reasonable  basis  to  dispute  the  legitimacy  of  the \\npast-due  debt  which \\nthe  problem  and  provides \\ndocumented  proof  to  substantiate  the  basis  of  the  dispute  or  provides \\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \\n \\n \\nApplicant has not acted responsibly, or in a timely manner, to attempt to resolve \\nhis remaining delinquent debt. His debt is current and on-going as demonstrated by the \\nunresolved debts in SOR subparagraphs 1.a, 1.f, and 1.g. Applicant’s conduct does not \\nwarrant application of AG ¶ 20(a).  \\n \\nApplicant’s debts, which were identified in the SOR, may have been due, in part, \\n \\nto his unemployment and underemployment and his wife’s unemployment. However, he \\nalso  made  the  decision  to  pay  for  his  daughter’s  university  education,  instead  of  his \\nprimary  mortgage  and  other  debts.  Further,  he  failed  to  demonstrate  responsible \\nbehavior  toward  those  accounts  that  remain  unresolved.  AG  ¶  20(b)  is  only  partially \\nmitigating. \\n \\n \\nApplicant  provided  no  evidence  of  the  depth  or  duration  of  any  financial \\ncounseling.  There  are  no  clear  indications  that  his  delinquent  debts  in  subparagraphs \\n1.a,  1.f,  and  1.g  are  being  resolved  or  are  under  control.  Mitigation  under  AG  ¶  20(c) \\nhas not been established. \\n \\n \\nApplicant  resolved  the  debts  in  subparagraphs  1.b,  1.c,  and  1.h,  and  is  making \\npayments  toward  the  resolution  of  the  debts  in  subparagraphs  1.d  and  1.e.  Mitigation \\nunder AG ¶ 20(d) applies in part to the debts identified in subparagraphs 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, \\n1.e, and 1.h. \\n \\n \\nAG  ¶  20(e)  requires  Applicant  to  provide  documented  proof  to  substantiate  the \\nbasis of any dispute or provide evidence of actions to resolve the issue. Applicant has \\nnot  provided  evidence  of  any  formal  dispute  or a basis for one.  Mitigation  under  AG  ¶ \\n20(e) has not been established. \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n6 \\n\\n\n",
       "The  security  concern  relating  to  the  guideline for  Foreign  Influence  is  set  out  in \\n\\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \\n \\n \\nAG ¶ 6: \\n \\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \\nany  foreign  interest.  Adjudication  under  this  Guideline  can  and  should \\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \\nfinancial \\nto,  such \\nconsiderations  as  whether  the  foreign  country  is  known  to  target  United \\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \\nrisk of terrorism. \\n\\nincluding,  but  not \\n\\ninterest \\n\\nis \\n\\nlocated, \\n\\nlimited \\n\\n \\n\\nThe  guideline  notes  several  conditions  that could  raise  security  concerns  under \\n\\nAG ¶ 7. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \\n\\n \\n(a)  contact  with  a  foreign  family  member,  business  or  professional \\nassociate,  friend,  or  other  person  who  is  a  citizen  of  or  resident  in  a \\nforeign  country  if  that  contact  creates  a  heightened  risk  of  foreign \\nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \\n \\n(b)  connections  to  a  foreign  person,  group,  government,  or  country  that \\ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual’s obligation to \\nprotect  sensitive  information  or  technology  and  the  individual’s  desire  to \\nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information. \\n \\nApplicant’s  mother  and  five  siblings  are  Vietnamese  citizens  and  reside  in  the \\n  \\nVietnam. Due to his ties to his family, and the threats present in Vietnam as set out in \\nItem  6,  a  heightened  risk  of  foreign  exploitation,  inducement,  manipulation,  pressure, \\nand  coercion  is  present.  The  evidence  is  sufficient  to  raise  the  above  disqualifying \\nconditions. \\n \\n \\nof the mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 8 including: \\n \\n\\nAG ¶ 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \\n\\n(a) the nature of the relationship with foreign persons, the country in which \\nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \\nthat  country  are  such  that  it  is  unlikely  the  individual  will  be  placed  in  a \\nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \\ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.;  \\n \\n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual’s sense of \\nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \\nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n7 \\n\\n\n",
       "and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \\nconflict of interests in favor of the U.S. interests; and \\n \\n(c)  contact  or  communication  with  foreign  citizens  is  so  casual  and \\ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \\ninfluence or exploitation. \\n \\nApplicant  maintains  relationships  with  his  mother  and  siblings,  who  are  citizens \\nand residents of Vietnam. His contact with his mother is the most frequent. The Appeal \\nBoard has held that there is a rebuttable presumption that ties with immediate family are \\nnot  casual.1  The  evidence  shows  that  Applicant  maintains  his  relationship  with  his \\nmother  during  the  year  through  phone  calls  and  her  annual  visits.  He  also  maintains \\nregular contact with his siblings, although that contact is not as frequent as it is with his \\nmother. While none of Applicant’s foreign family members are aware of his request for a \\nsecurity  clearance,  given  these  facts  and  Applicant's  close  ties  to  his  foreign  family \\nmembers, I cannot confidently conclude that Applicant could not be placed in a position \\nof having to choose between the interests of foreign individuals and the interests of the \\nUnited States. AG ¶ 8 (a) and (c) do not apply. \\n\\n \\n Applicant  has  established  deep  and  longstanding  relationships  in  the  United \\nStates. He spent a formative part of his youth in the U.S and attended college here. He \\nchose  to  stay  in  the  United  States  after  finishing  his  education.  He  became  a  U.S. \\ncitizen.  He  is  married  to  an  American  citizen.  His  children  are  U.S.  citizens.  Applicant \\ncan  be expected  to  resolve  any  conflict  of  interest  in favor  of  the  United  States.  AG  ¶ \\n8(b) is mitigating. \\n \\nWhole-Person Concept \\n \\n \\nUnder  the  whole-person  concept,  the  administrative  judge  must  evaluate  an \\napplicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s \\nconduct  and  all  relevant  circumstances.

       " \\n\\nI  considered  the  potentially  disqualifying  and  mitigating  conditions  in  light  of  all \\nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \\nGuidelines F and B in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were \\naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. The Foreign \\nInfluence  concerns  related  to  Applicant’s  mother  and  siblings,  who  are  citizens  and \\nresidents  in Vietnam, are mitigated. However,  Applicant has not acted in a trustworthy \\nmanner  when  it  comes  to  addressing  his  financial  delinquencies.  There  is  insufficient \\nevidence  to  demonstrate  that  recurrence  of  financial  irresponsibility  is  unlikely.  The \\npotential for pressure, coercion, or duress remains undiminished. \\n\\n \\nOverall,  the  record  evidence  leaves  me  with  questions  and  doubts  as  to \\nApplicant’s  eligibility  and  suitability  for  a  security  clearance.  For  all  these  reasons,  I \\nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Financial Considerations security concerns. \\n\\n \\n\\nFormal Findings \\n\\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \\n\\n \\n \\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \\n \\n\\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nSubparagraphs 1.a:  \\nSubparagraphs 1.b:  \\nSubparagraphs 1.c:  \\nSubparagraphs 1.d:  \\nSubparagraphs 1.e:  \\nSubparagraphs 1.f:   \\nSubparagraphs 1.g:  \\nSubparagraphs 1.h:  \\n \\n\\nParagraph 2, Guideline B:   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nSubparagraph 2.a:   \\nSubparagraph 2.b:   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\nAGAINST APPLICANT \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\nAgainst Applicant \\nFor Applicant \\nFor Applicant \\nFor Applicant \\nFor Applicant \\nAgainst Applicant \\nAgainst Applicant \\nFor Applicant \\n\\nFOR APPLICANT \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\nFor Applicant \\nFor Applicant \\n\\nConclusion \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it  is not \\nclearly  consistent  with  the  national  interest  to  grant  Applicant  eligibility  for  a  security \\nclearance.

       "The Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On\\nAugust 19, 2015, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\\ndecision–security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of\\nDefense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a decision\\non the written record.  On June 27, 2016, after considering the record, Defense Office of Hearings\\nand Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Martin H. Mogul denied Applicant’s request for a\\nsecurity clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive ¶¶ E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\\n\\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in making findings\\nof fact and whether the Judge’s decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent\\nwith the following, we affirm.\\n\\nThe Judge’s Findings of Fact  \\n\\nApplicant is 46 years old, married, and has four children.  He earned a bachelor’s degree in\\n1994.    Since  2010,  he  has  been  employed  by  a  defense  contractor.    In  his  security  clearance\\napplication, he explained that he encountered difficultly paying bills in 2008 after being laid off\\nfrom a second job due to the company’s bankruptcy.  He gave no explanation for why he did not\\nbegin attempting to resolve the debts until the issuance of the SOR.\\n\\nApplicant admitted each of the five delinquent debts alleged in the SOR.  For the debt in\\nSOR  ¶  1.a  for  about  $500,  Applicant  wrote  in  his  Response  to  Department  Counsel’s  File  of\\nRelevant Material (FORM) that the debt was paid off.  The creditor agreed to accept three monthly\\npayments of about $100 to settle the debt.  A document showed the creditor made arrangements with\\nApplicant to debit electronically about $100 from his account in September 2015 for this debt.  For\\nthe 2009 judgment in SOR ¶ 1.b for about $14,000, Applicant indicated that, at the time he answered\\nthe SOR, he was unable to negotiate a settlement.  In his Response to the FORM, he provided\\ndocuments showing his wages were being garnished biweekly for the next six months for this debt\\nand about $350 was garnished from his pay at the end of November 2015.  No evidence was\\npresented to establish the total amount deducted from his pay or how much is still owed on that debt. \\nFor the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 1.b, and 1.c for about $2,500, $5,600, and $3600, Applicant wrote in\\nhis Response to the FORM that he is currently on a schedule to repay between $150 and $190 a\\nmonth on each debt until it is resolved.  He provided proof of payments toward those debts from\\nSeptember through November 2015.\\n\\nThe Judge’s Analysis\\n\\nThe  Judge  found  Applicant  did  not  act  responsibly  because,  even  though  he  has  been\\nemployed by his current employer since 2010, he only began making payments towards the debts\\nafter the SOR was issued.  The Judge also concluded that, while the mitigation condition concerning\\nthe initiation of a good-faith effort to repay the creditors was applicable, it was not controlling\\nbecause Applicant must establish a consistent history of continuing to resolve his debts. \\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\n2\\n\\n\n",
       "In the appeal brief, Applicant provided character reference letters and documents showing\\npayments  on,  or  settlement  of,  various  debts.    Most  of  those  documents,  however,  were  not\\npreviously submitted to the Judge and constitute new evidence that the Appeal Board is prohibited\\nfrom receiving or considering.  Directive ¶ E3.1.29.  \\n\\nApplicant claims the Judge erred in the findings of fact.  For example, he states that he has\\nsix children (instead of four) and started working for his current employer in 2012 (instead of 2010). \\nIn  his  security  clearance  application,  however,  Applicant  listed  that  he  had  four  children  and\\nindicated he started working for his employer in 2010.  He failed to establish that the Judge erred\\nin the findings of fact.  Our review reveals the Judge’s material findings are based upon substantial\\nevidence or constitute reasonable inferences or conclusions that could be drawn from the record\\nevidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-03420 at 3 (App. Bd. July 25, 2014).  Applicant also argues\\nthat he mitigated the security concerns arising from his debts.  His arguments are not sufficient to\\nshow that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to\\nlaw.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-06634 at 2 (App. Bd. Apr. 28, 2016).   \\n   \\n\\nThe Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the\\ndecision.  The decision is sustainable on this record.  “The general standard is that a clearance may\\nbe granted only when ‘clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.’” Department\\nof the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  See also Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b):  “Any doubt\\nconcerning personnel being considered for access to classified information will be resolved in favor\\nof the national security.”\\n\\nThe Decision is AFFIRMED.  \\n\\nOrder\\n\\nSigned: Michael Ra’anan        \\nMichael Ra’anan\\nAdministrative Judge\\nChairperson, Appeal Board\\n\\nSigned: James E.

(Item\\n1.)  The  action  was  taken  under  Executive  Order  10865,  Safeguarding  Classified\\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\\nDirective  5220.6,  Defense  Industrial  Personnel  Security  Clearance  Review  Program\\n(January  2,  1992),  as  amended  (Directive);  and  the  adjudicative  guidelines  (AG)\\neffective within the Department of Defense after September 1, 2006. \\n\\n \\nOn September 12, 2015, Applicant replied to the SOR (RSOR) in writing, and he\\nrequested that his case be decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. (Item 1.)\\nOn  October  27,  2015,  Department  Counsel  issued  the  Department's  written  case.  A\\ncomplete  copy  of  the  file  of  relevant  material  (FORM)  was  provided  to  Applicant  on\\nNovember  4,  2015.  In  the  FORM,  Department  Counsel  offered  six  documentary\\nexhibits. (Items 1-6.) Applicant was given the opportunity to file objections and submit\\nmaterial in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. A response was due by December 10,\\n2015. Applicant submitted additional evidence, which has been identified and entered\\ninto  evidence  as  Items  A  through  G.  The  case  was  assigned  to  this  Administrative\\n\\n1\\n\\n\n",
       "Judge on January 5, 2016. Based upon a review of the pleadings and exhibits, eligibility\\nfor access to classified information is denied.\\n\\nFindings of Fact\\n\\nAfter  a  complete  and  thorough  review  of  the  evidence  in  the  record,  including\\nApplicant's RSOR and the FORM, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make\\nthe following findings of fact: \\n\\nApplicant  is  46  years  old,  and  he  is  married  and  has  4  children.  He  earned  a\\nBachelor’s  degree  in  1994.  Applicant  has  been  employed  since  2010  as  a  Computer\\nOperator by his current employer,  a defense contractor, and he seeks a DoD security\\nclearance in connection with his employment in the defense sector. (Items 2, F.)\\n\\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\\n\\nThe  SOR  lists  five  allegations  (1.a.  through  1.e.)  regarding  financial  difficulties,\\nspecifically  delinquent  debts,  under  Adjudicative  Guideline  F.  The  allegations  will  be\\ndiscussed below in the same order as they were listed on the SOR:\\n\\n1.a. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR for a collection account in the amount\\nof $518.  In his RSOR, Applicant admitted this SOR allegation. In his Post-FORM letter,\\nApplicant wrote that this debt had been paid off. Applicant also included a letter from the\\ncreditor indicating that they would accept three monthly payments of $104.48 to settle\\nthis debt. (Item A.) Item E shows that the creditor made an arrangement with Applicant\\nto debit electronically $104.48 from Applicant’s account on September 11, 2015, for this\\ndebt.\\n\\n1.b. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR for a judgement filed against Applicant\\nin  April  2009,  in  the  amount  of  $14,892.    In  his  RSOR,  Applicant  admitted  this  SOR\\nallegation,  and  he  wrote  that  he  was  unable  to  negotiate  at  this  time.  (Item  1.)  In  his\\nPost-FORM letter, Applicant wrote that this judgment debt had been placed with a law\\nfirm that informed Applicant a portion of his wages would be garnished bi-weekly for the\\nnext  six  months.  (Item  A.)  Items  F  and  G  show  that  $357.73  was  deducted  from  the\\npaycheck of Applicant on November 29, 2015.  No evidence was introduced to establish\\nthe total amount that has been deducted from Applicant’s pay or how much is still owing\\non this debt. \\n\\n1.c. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR for a collection account in the amount\\nof $2,506. In his RSOR, Applicant admitted this SOR allegation. (Item 1.) In his Post-\\nFORM letter, Applicant wrote that he is currently on a payment schedule for this debt to\\npay $156.25 a month until this debt is resolved. (Item A.) Item E shows that Applicant\\nhas  made  one  payment  of  $163.75  on  September  14,  2015,  and  two  payments  of\\n$156.25 on October 14, 2015, and November 17, 2015, toward this debt.\\n\\n1.d. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR for a collection account in the amount\\nof $5,649. In his RSOR, Applicant admitted this SOR allegation. (Item 1.) In his Post-\\n\\n2\\n\\n\n",
       "FORM letter, Applicant wrote that he is currently on a payment schedule for this debt to\\npay $187.90 a month until this debt is resolved. (Item A.) Item D shows that Applicant\\nhas made three payments of $187.90 on September 28, 2015; October 26, 2015; and\\nNovember 23, 2015; and three additional payments of $104.48.\\n\\n1.e. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR for a collection account in the amount\\nof $3,677.  In his RSOR, Applicant admitted this SOR allegation. (Item 1.) In his Post-\\nFORM letter, Applicant wrote that he is currently on a payment schedule for this debt to\\npay $155 a month until this debt is resolved. (Item A.) Item C shows that Applicant has\\nmade two payments of $155 on October 26, 2015, and November 23, 2015, toward this\\ndebt.\\n\\nApplicant  completed  an  Electronic  Questionnaires  for  Investigations  Processing\\n(e-QIP) on July 26, 2011, and he explained each of his delinquent debts, writing, “In Year\\n2008, had difficulty paying bills due to being laid off at 2  job due to company file [sic]\\nbankruptcy.”  (Item  2.)  As  reviewed  above,  Applicant  began  working  at  his present\\nemployment in 2010, but he gave no explanation for why he did not begin attempting to\\nresolve his debts until  2015, after the SOR was issued. \\n\\nnd\\n\\nPolicies\\n\\nWhen  evaluating  an  applicant’s  suitability \\n\\nthe\\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\\nto  brief  introductory  explanations  for  each  guideline,  the  adjudicative  guidelines  list\\npotentially  disqualifying  conditions  and  mitigating  conditions,  which  are  useful  in\\nevaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information.\\n\\nfor  a  security  clearance, \\n\\nThese  guidelines  are  not  inflexible  rules  of  law.  Instead,  recognizing  the\\ncomplexities  of  human  behavior,  these  guidelines  are  applied  in  conjunction  with  the\\nfactors  listed  in  the  adjudicative  process.  The  administrative  judge’s  over-arching\\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 2(c),\\nthe  entire  process  is  a  conscientious  scrutiny  of  a  number  of  variables  known  as  the\\n“whole-person  concept.”  The  administrative  judge  must  consider  all  available,  reliable\\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\\ndecision.\\n\\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b)\\nrequires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\\ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this decision, I have\\ndrawn  only  those  conclusions  that  are  reasonable,  logical  and  based  on  the  evidence\\ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere\\nspeculation or conjecture.\\n\\nUnder  Directive  ¶  E3.1.14,  the  Government  must  present  evidence  to  establish\\ncontroverted  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  Under  Directive  ¶  E3.1.15,  the  Applicant  is\\nresponsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\\nmitigate  facts  admitted  by  applicant  or  proven  by  Department  Counsel.  .  .  .”  The\\n\\n3\\n\\n\n",
       "Applicant  has  the  ultimate  burden  of  persuasion  as  to  obtaining  a  favorable  security\\ndecision. \\n\\nA  person  who  seeks  access  to  classified  information  enters  into  a  fiduciary\\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government\\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\\nthe  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  protect  or  safeguard  classified\\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as\\nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\\n\\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of\\nthe  national  interest and  shall in no  sense be  a determination  as  to the  loyalty  of  the\\napplicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \\n\\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\\n\\nAnalysis\\n\\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\\n\\nout in AG ¶ 18:  \\n\\n      Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet\\nfinancial  obligations  may  indicate  poor  self-control,  lack  of  judgment,  or\\nunwillingness  to  abide  by  rules  and  regulations,  all  of  which  can  raise\\nquestions  about  an  individual’s  reliability,  trustworthiness  and  ability  to\\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \\n\\nThe  guideline  notes  several  conditions  that  could  raise  security  concerns  and\\ncould potentially apply in this case.  Under AG ¶ 19(a), “an inability or unwillingness to\\nsatisfy  debts,”  is  potentially  disqualifying.  Similarly  under  AG  ¶  19(c),  “a  history  of  not\\nmeeting  financial  obligations,”  may  raise  security  concerns.  I  find  that  both  of  these\\ndisqualifying  conditions  apply  to  Applicant  in  this  case.  The  evidence  has  established\\nthat Applicant accumulated significant delinquent debt several years ago.  \\n\\nAG ¶ 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns from financial\\ndifficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(b), it may be mitigating where, “the conditions that resulted in\\nthe financial problem were largely beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment,\\na  business  downturn,  unexpected  medical  emergency,  or  a  death,  divorce  or\\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.” As reviewed\\nabove,  some  of  Applicant’s  financial  difficulties  occurred  as  a  result  of  his  periods  of\\nunemployment. However, since Applicant has been employed by his current employer\\nsince 2010, and only began making payments toward the SOR debts after the SOR was\\n\\n4\\n\\n\n",
       "issued in 2015, I find that Applicant has not acted responsibly. Accordingly, I find that this\\nmitigating condition is not applicable in this case. \\n\\n¶  20(d)  is  now  applicable  but  not  controlling,  since  Applicant  has  begun  taking\\naction to “initiate a good-faith effort to repay his overdue creditors or otherwise resolve\\ndebts,”  because  even  though  he  has  been  working  at  his  present  employment  since\\n2010,  he  did  not  begin  this  process  until  after  the  SOR  was  issued  in  2015.  To  be\\napplicable and controlling in the future, Applicant must establish a consistent history of\\ncontinuing  to  resolve  these  delinquent  past  debts  and  not  become  past  due  on  his\\npresent debts. At this time, I find Guideline F against Applicant.\\n\\nWhole-Person Concept\\n\\nUnder  the  whole-person  concept,  the  administrative  judge  must  evaluate  an\\napplicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s\\nconduct  and  all  the  circumstances.  The  administrative  judge  should  consider  the  nine\\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a): \\n\\nthe  conduct, \\n\\nto \\n\\n(1)  the  nature,  extent,  and  seriousness  of  the  conduct;  (2)  the\\ncircumstances  surrounding \\ninclude  knowledgeable\\nparticipation;  (3)  the  frequency  and  recency  of  the  conduct;  (4)  the\\nindividual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\\nwhich  participation \\nthe  presence  or  absence  of\\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\\nfor  the  conduct;  (8)  the  potential  for  pressure,  coercion,  exploitation,  or\\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\\n\\nis  voluntary;  (6) \\n\\nUnder AG ¶ 2 (c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\\nsecurity  clearance  must  be  an  overall  commonsense  judgment  based  upon  careful\\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.      \\n\\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the\\nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. Based on all of the reasons cited above\\nas to why the mitigating conditions are not applicable at this time, I find that the record\\nevidence leaves me with significant questions and doubts as to Applicant’s eligibility and\\nsuitability  for  a  security  clearance  under  the  whole-person  concept.  For  all  these\\nreasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns under the whole-\\nperson concept. \\n\\nFormal Findings\\n\\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\\n\\nrequired by ¶ E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\\n\\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\\n\\nAGAINST APPLICANT\\n\\nSubparagraphs 1.a. - 1.e.:\\n\\nAgainst  Applicant\\n\\n5\\n\\n\n",
       "Conclusion\\n\\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\\nclearly  consistent  with  the  national  interest  to  grant  Applicant  eligibility  for  a  security\\nclearance.

He  is  a  39-year-old  analyst \\nemployed  by  a  defense  contractor  since  March  2015.  He  worked  for  a  prior  defense \\ncontractor,  at  a  U.S.  Embassy  overseas,  from  January  2008  to  February  2009.  He \\nworked for another defense contractor from August 2010 to November 2012. He was \\ngranted eligibility for a public trust position by another federal agency in 2008. He was \\ngranted a DOD security clearance in 2014.1  \\n\\n \\nApplicant  is  a  native-born  U.S. citizen  and  resident. He  obtained  a  high-school \\ndiploma in the United States in 1996 and a bachelor’s degree from a U.S. university in \\n2001. He was previously married from September 2009 to November 2010. As of the \\nhearing, he was engaged to a native-born U.S. citizen. He does not have any children.2 \\n\\n \\nApplicant enlisted and served as an active duty infantryman in the Israeli military \\nfrom November 2004 to February 2006. Upon completion of his service, he declined an \\noffer to serve in the Israeli military reserves and was honorably discharged. His primary \\nmotivation for serving in the Israeli military was to develop the skills and experience that \\nwould assist him in furthering a career in security in support of the U.S. Government. He \\ninitially desired to serve in the U.S. military, but learned when he spoke to recruiters that \\nhe  was  ineligible  due  to  a  longstanding  medical  condition.  He  explored  alternative \\noptions  to  serve  the  U.S.  Government  through  security  positions  with  defense \\ncontractors  and  in  the  private  sector,  but  discovered  that  all  such  positions  required \\nprior military experience. He did not inquire whether his medical condition would have \\ndisqualified him from holding these positions since he did not meet the requisite criteria \\nof  prior  military  service.  He  did  not  explore  options  that  did  not  require  prior  military \\n\\n                                                           \\n1 Applicant’s response to the SOR; Tr. at 24-25, 70-77; GEs 1-3; AE B.  \\n \\n2 Tr. at 55-125; GE 1. \\n \\n\\n \\n2 \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "experience because such positions would not have provided him with the opportunity to \\ndevelop skills in his desired field.3   \\n\\n \\nApplicant discovered through internet research a program designed for overseas \\nJewish volunteers who had an interest in serving in the Israeli military, so long as one \\nprovided evidence of Jewish heritage. He decided then, at the age of 23, that it was a \\nreasonable option for him to serve in the Israeli military given that the United States and \\nIsrael  were  allies  with  mutual  adversaries.  He  made  this  decision  on  his  own.  He \\ndiscussed  his  decision  with  his  parents,  and  their  conversations  revolved  primarily \\naround their concern for Applicant’s safety.4 \\n\\n \\nIn  2004,  Applicant  traveled  to  Israel  to  join  the  Israeli  military.  Acting  on  the \\nrecommendation  that  he  have  a  basic  proficiency  of  Hebrew  prior  to  enlistment, \\nApplicant  first  engaged  in  a  five-month  language  instruction  program.  The  language \\nprogram  was  not  affiliated  with  the  Israeli  military.  He  subsequently  enlisted  and  the \\nIsraeli military sent him to additional language training.5  \\n\\n \\nDuring the enlistment process, Applicant lied and told the Israeli military that he \\ndid  not  have  the  medical  condition  that  rendered  him  ineligible  to  serve  in  the  U.S. \\nmilitary. He did so because he was told, at an initial enlistment meeting when he arrived \\nin Israel, that his longstanding medical condition, combined with another of his medical \\nconditions, would have lowered his physical profile to such a degree that would have \\ndisqualified  him  from  serving  as  an  infantryman.  He  was  previously  unaware  of  this \\ninformation. He understood from his internet research prior to traveling to Israel that he \\nwould  be  permitted  to  serve  in  some  capacity  despite  his  medical  condition.  He  also \\nunderstood that his medical condition was not necessarily a disqualifier for joining the \\ninfantry.6  \\n\\n \\nApplicant  determined  that  while  he  was  unwilling  to  lie  to  the  U.S.  military  and \\ngovernment about this particular medical condition, it was acceptable for him to lie to \\nthe  Israeli  military  and  government  since  he  did  not  have  any  allegiance  to  them.  He \\nwas not concerned his medical condition would be discovered because he managed it \\nand  was  able  to  maintain  a  high  level  of  fitness.  He  disclosed  his  other  medical \\ncondition  and  medical  history to the  Israeli  military.  In the  13  years that  have  passed \\nsince his enlistment in the Israeli military, Applicant has matured. He understands now \\nthat he should have disclosed his longstanding medical condition to the Israeli military, \\neven if such a disclosure would have prevented him from serving as an infantryman.7   \\n  \\n                                                           \\n3 Tr. at 55-125; GEs 1-3; AEs A, C. \\n \\n4 Tr. at 55-125; GE 3.  \\n \\n5 Tr. at 55-125; GEs 2-3. \\n \\n6 Tr. at 55-125; GE 3. \\n \\n7 Tr. at 55-125; GE 3. \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n3 \\n \\n\\n\n",
       " \\nApplicant’s  ex-girlfriend  resides  in  Israel.  He  met  her  on  an  online  dating  site \\nwhen he attended the five-month language instruction program in Israel. He lived with \\nher while he was serving in the Israeli military. He last communicated with her in 2007. \\nWhen  Applicant  moved  back  to  the  United  States  from  Israel  in  2007,  he  had  social \\nmedia contact with her. He also had social media contact with her one sister who also \\nresides  in  Israel,  and  several  individuals  in  Israel  with  whom  Applicant  served  in  the \\nIsraeli  military,  to  include  his  unit  supervisor.  After  he  received  the  SOR,  Applicant \\ndeleted all of his foreign contacts on social media. He had not previously deleted them \\nbecause  he  consulted  and  was  advised  by  a  former  colleague  that  doing  so  at  once \\nmight trigger to any one of his foreign contacts who might be working in the intelligence \\nfield that he was pursuing a sensitive position. He ultimately decided that since he was \\nnot  in  communication  with  any  of  his  foreign  contacts,  he  did  not  need  to  maintain  a \\nsocial  media  connection  with  them.  Since  he  deleted  his  foreign  contacts  on  social \\nmedia, some have tried to reconnect with him but Applicant has not responded and has \\nno intentions of doing so.8 \\n  \\n \\nApplicant maintains contact with one individual, a U.S. citizen and resident, with \\nwhom Applicant served in the Israeli military. This individual is the founder and CEO of \\na civilian national service organization that has no connections to the Israeli government \\nor military. As an American Jew, this individual chose to serve in the Israeli military and \\ndid  so  for  two  years  in  the  same  unit  as  Applicant.  He  attested  that  both  he  and \\nApplicant  were  low-level  infantrymen.  Since  their  discharge  from  the  Israeli  military, \\nApplicant  and \\nindividual  see  each  other  once  yearly  and  communicate \\napproximately twice yearly.9 \\n \\nAfter  graduating  from  college  and  before  he  served  in  the  Israeli  military, \\n \\nApplicant took a trip to Israel in August 2002 through a birthright program. The program \\nhelped teach him about his Jewish culture. Subsequent to his Israeli military service and \\nduring a period of unemployment, he traveled to Israel in June 2010 through the same \\nbirthright  program.  On  this  occasion,  he  served  as  a  volunteer  male  counselor  to  the \\nprogram.  He  did  not  see  any  of  his  former  Israeli  military  contacts  or  his  ex-girlfriend \\nduring this trip. Both trips were comprised of U.S. citizens, all Jewish Americans, who \\nwanted  to  travel  to  Israel  to  learn  more  about  their  Jewish  culture.  He  has  not  since \\ntraveled  to  Israel.  Should  he  travel  to  Israel  or  any  foreign  country  in  the  future,  he \\nunderstands  as  a  security  clearance  holder  the  requirement  to  report  such  foreign \\ntravel.10 \\n \\n \\nApplicant did not have an Israeli security clearance when he served in the Israeli \\nmilitary. He has never been an Israeli citizen, as he was not required to become one in \\norder to serve in the Israeli military, and as such he has never held an Israeli passport. \\nHe chose not to become an Israeli citizen or obtain an Israeli passport because he did \\n\\nthis \\n\\n                                                           \\n8 Tr. at 55-125; GEs 1-3. \\n \\n9 Tr. at 55-125; GEs 1-3; AE F. \\n \\n10 Tr. at 55-125; GEs 1-3. \\n \\n\\n \\n4 \\n \\n\\n\n",

He rented two apartments in Israel as he was required to maintain a home of \\nrecord  during  the  course  of  his  Israeli  military  service.

His  parents,  sibling,  and \\nfiancée are native-born U.S. citizens and residents. His father worked for many years \\nfor a defense contractor. His fiancée, who works for the U.S. Government and holds a \\nDOD security clearance, testified that Applicant disclosed his Israeli military service to \\nher  when  they  met  in  May  2014.  She  described  Applicant  as  passionate  about  the \\nUnited  States.  Applicant’s  supervisor  also  testified  that  he  was  aware  of  Applicant’s \\nprior Israeli military service and described Applicant as an exceptional performer, with \\nno reason to question his character, integrity, or loyalty to the United States. Applicant \\nalso provided letters of support from his neighbor and mentor, both of whom were also \\naware of Applicant’s Israeli military service and who described Applicant as trustworthy \\nand loyal to the United States.13    \\n \\nIsrael \\n \\n \\nDefense, diplomatic, and economic cooperation between the United States and \\nIsrael has been close for decades. Strong bilateral relations have fueled and reinforced \\nsignificant  cooperation  between  the  United  States  and  Israel  on  defense-related \\nmatters. Aid for Israel has been designed to maintain Israel’s qualitative military edge \\nover neighboring militaries, since Israel must rely on better equipment and training to \\ncompensate for a manpower deficit in any potential regional conflict. However, U.S. aid \\nto  Israel  is  not  unlimited.  Sales  of  U.S.  defense  articles  and  services  to  Israel  are \\nsubject to the Arms Export Control Act (AECA) and the July 23, 1952, Mutual Defense \\n                                                           \\n11 Tr. at 55-125; GEs 1-3; AE F. \\n \\n12 Tr. at 55-125; GE 1. \\n \\n13 Tr. at 55-125; AEs D-E. \\n\\n \\n5 \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "Assistance Agreement between the United  States and Israel. AECA enumerates the \\npurposes  for  which  foreign  governments  can  use  U.S.  military  articles  and  limits  the \\nability of foreign governments to transfer U.S. military products to third party countries \\nwithout the prior consent of the President of the United States. The 1952 agreement \\nstates  that  the  government  of  Israel  assures  the  United  States  government  that \\nequipment, materials, or services acquired from the United States are required for and \\nwill  be  used  solely  to  maintain  Israel’s  internal  security  and  Israel’s  legitimate  self-\\ndefense.  \\n \\n \\nAlthough the United States has provided regular military support to Israel, there \\nis a significant documented history of classified information and controlled technologies \\nbeing illegally imported to Israel. These include parts used in fighter jets, spy software, \\ncomponents  for  certain  missiles  and  fighter  jet  aircraft,  digital  oscilloscopes  that  are \\ncapable of being utilized in the development of weapons of mass destruction and  in \\nmissile  delivery  fields,  a  product  containing  a  certain  chemical  precursor  that  is \\ncontrolled  for  chemical,  biological,  antiterrorism,  and  chemical  reasons,  pressure \\ntransducers  that  are  controlled  for  nuclear  non-proliferation  reasons,  encryption \\nsoftware  that  is  controlled  for  national  security  reasons,  and  classified  documents. \\nIllegal  technology  transfers,  even  to  private  Israeli  entities,  are  a  significant  concern \\nbecause  foreign  government  entities  have  learned  to  capitalize  on  private-sector \\ntechnology acquisitions.  \\n \\n \\nIn the past 30 years, there have been at least three cases in which employees \\nof the U.S. Government were convicted of disclosing classified information to Israel or \\nof  conspiracy  to  act  as  an  Israeli  agent.  Reports  indicate  that  concerns  regarding \\npossible Israeli espionage persist among U.S. officials. The most prominent espionage \\ncase is that of Jonathan Pollard. He pled guilty in 1986, with his then wife, to selling \\nclassified documents to Israel. Israel granted Pollard, who is serving a life sentence in \\na U.S. federal prison, citizenship in 1996 and, in 1998, acknowledged that Pollard had \\nbeen its agent. \\n \\n \\nA  travel  warning  issued  by  the  U.S.  Department  of  State  for  Israel,  the  West \\nBank, and Gaza remains in effect, as the security environment remains complex due to \\nheightened  tensions  and  security  risks.  U.S.  citizens  are  advised  that  all  persons \\nentering or departing Israel, the West Bank, or Gaza are subject to security screening, \\nand may be denied entry or exit. Israeli security officials have on occasion requested \\naccess  to  travelers’  personal  email  accounts  or  other  social  media  accounts  as  a \\ncondition  of  entry.  In  such  circumstances,  travelers  should  have  no  expectation  of \\nprivacy for any data stored on such devices or in their accounts. \\n  \\n\\n \\n\\nWhen  evaluating  an  applicant’s  suitability \\n\\n \\nthe \\nadministrative  judge  must  consider  the  adjudicative  guidelines.  In  addition  to  brief \\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \\ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \\napplicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. \\n\\nfor  a  security  clearance, \\n\\nPolicies \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n6 \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "These  guidelines  are  not  inflexible  rules  of  law.  Instead,  recognizing  the \\ncomplexities  of  human  behavior,  administrative  judges  apply  the  guidelines  in \\nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s \\noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \\nto  AG  ¶  2(a),  the  entire  process  is  a  conscientious  scrutiny  of  a  number  of  variables \\nknown  as  the  “whole-person  concept.”  The  administrative  judge  must  consider  all \\navailable,  reliable  information  about  the  person,  past  and  present,  favorable  and \\nunfavorable, in making a decision. \\n\\n \\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) \\nrequires  that  “[a]ny  doubt  concerning  personnel  being  considered  for  access  to \\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.”  \\n\\n \\nUnder Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \\ncontroverted  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  Under  Directive  ¶  E3.1.15,  the  applicant  is \\nresponsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \\nor  mitigate  facts  admitted  by  the  applicant  or  proven  by  Department  Counsel.”  The \\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \\n\\nthe  Government  predicated  upon \\n\\n \\nA  person  who  seeks  access  to  classified  information  enters  into  a  fiduciary \\n \\nrelationship  with \\ntrust  and  confidence.  This \\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \\nGovernment  reposes  a  high  degree  of  trust  and  confidence  in  individuals  to  whom  it \\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \\nthe  possible  risk  the  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  safeguard \\nclassified  information.  Such  decisions  entail  a  certain  degree  of  legally  permissible \\nextrapolation  of  potential,  rather  than  actual,  risk  of  compromise  of  classified \\ninformation. \\n \\n\\nSection 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be “in terms \\nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \\napplicant  concerned.”  See  also  Exec.  Or.  12968,  Section  3.1(b)  (listing  multiple \\nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \\n\\nAnalysis \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \\n \\n\\nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG ¶ 6:       \\n\\nForeign  contacts  and  interests,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  business, \\nfinancial,  and  property  interests,  are  a  national  security  concern  if  they \\nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \\nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \\nway  inconsistent  with  U.S.  interests  or  otherwise  made  vulnerable  to \\npressure  or  coercion  by  any  foreign  interest.  Assessment  of  foreign \\n\\n \\n7 \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "contacts  and  interests  should  consider  the  country  in  which  the  foreign \\ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \\nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \\nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \\n \\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \\n\\nAG ¶ 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \\n\\ninformation  or \\n\\n \\n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \\nor  professional  associate,  friend,  or  other  person  who  is  a  citizen  of  or \\nresident  in  a  foreign  country  if  that  contact  creates  a  heightened  risk  of \\nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \\n \\n(b)  connections  to  a  foreign  person,  group,  government,  or  country  that \\ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \\nprotect  classified  or  sensitive \\nthe \\nindividual’s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \\nthat information or technology. \\n \\nThe  nature  of  a  nation’s  government,  its  relationship  with  the  United  States, \\nand its human  rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant’s \\nfamily  members  are  vulnerable  to  government  coercion.  The  risk  of  coercion, \\npersuasion,  or  duress  is  significantly  greater \\nforeign  country  has  an \\nauthoritarian  government,  a  family member is associated with or dependent upon the \\ngovernment,  or  the  country  is  known  to  conduct  intelligence  operations  against  the \\nUnited  States.  In  considering  the  nature  of  the  government,  an  administrative  judge \\nmust  also  consider  any  terrorist  activity  in  the  country  at  issue.  See  generally  ISCR \\nCase  No.  02-26130  at  3  (App.  Bd.  Dec.  7,  2006)  (reversing  decision  to  grant \\nclearance  where  administrative  judge  did  not  consider  terrorist  activity  in  area  where \\nfamily members resided). \\n \\n\\ntechnology  and \\n\\nif \\n\\nthe \\n\\nAG  ¶  7(a)  requires  substantial  evidence  of  a  “heightened  risk.”  The \\n“heightened  risk” required to raise one of these disqualifying conditions is a relatively \\nlow standard.  “Heightened risk” denotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in \\nhaving a family member living under a foreign government. \\n\\n \\nApplicant has not communicated with his ex-girlfriend in Israel since 2007. When \\nApplicant moved back to the United States from Israel in 2007, he had limited social \\nmedia contact with her, her one sister, and several other individuals in Israel with whom \\nhe served in the Israeli military. He deleted all of his social media foreign contacts after \\nhe received the SOR. He has not responded and has no intentions of responding to any \\nattempts  by  these  foreign  contacts  to  reconnect  on  social  media.  While  Applicant \\nmaintains  contact with one individual  with  whom he served in the Israeli military, this \\nindividual is a U.S. citizen and resident with no ties to the Israeli government or military.       \\nAG ¶¶ 7(a) and 7(b) are not established. \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n8 \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "Guideline C, Foreign Preference \\n \\n\\nThe security concern for foreign preference is set out in AG ¶ 9:     \\n \\nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign \\ncountry over the United States, then he or she may provide information or make \\ndecisions  that  are  harmful  to  the  interests  of  the  United  States.  Foreign \\ninvolvement  raises  concerns  about  an  individual's  judgment,  reliability,  and \\ntrustworthiness  when  it  is  in  conflict  with  U.S.  national  interests  or  when  the \\nindividual acts to conceal it. By itself; the fact that a U.S. citizen is also a citizen \\nof  another  country  is  not  disqualifying  without  an  objective  showing  of  such \\nconflict or attempt at concealment. The same is true for a U.S. citizen's exercise \\nof any right or privilege of foreign citizenship and any action to acquire or obtain \\nrecognition of a foreign citizenship. \\n \\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \\n\\nAG ¶ 10. The following is potentially applicable in this case:   \\n\\n \\n(d) participation in foreign activities, including but not limited to: \\n\\n(1) assuming or attempting to assume any type of employment, position, or  \\npolitical office in a foreign government or military organization. \\n\\nApplicant’s service in the Israeli military from November 2004 to February 2006 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nraises AG ¶ 10(d).   \\n \\n\\nConditions that could mitigate foreign preference security concerns are provided  \\n\\nunder AG ¶ 11. The following are potentially applicable: \\n \\n\\n(f)  the  foreign  preference,  if  detected,  involves  a  foreign  country,  entity,  or \\nassociation that poses a low national security risk; and \\n \\n(g) civil employment or military service was authorized under U.S. law, or  \\nthe employment or service was otherwise consented to as required by U.S. law. \\n \\n \\nAs  a  23  year  old,  Applicant  decided  that  serving  in  the  Israeli  military  would \\nenable him to further his desired career in security in support of the U.S. Government. \\nSince  his  longstanding  medical  condition,  which  he  determined  he  did  not  have  to \\ndisclose to the Israeli military, rendered him ineligible to serve in the U.S. military, he \\nviewed  his  decision  as  a  reasonable  option.  That  the  United  States  and  Israel  were \\nallies  with  mutual  adversaries  also  factored  into  his  decision.  He  has  matured  since \\nthen.  He  acknowledged  he  should  have  disclosed  his  medical  condition  to  the  Israeli \\nmilitary. His Israeli military service occurred between 11 and 13 years ago. He no longer \\nhas any ties to the Israeli government or military. He has never been an Israeli citizen, \\nhe  has  never  held  an  Israeli  passport,  and  he  has  never  held  an  Israeli  security \\nclearance. AG ¶¶ 11(f) and 11(g) are applicable. \\n  \\n\\n \\n9 \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "Whole-Person Concept \\n \\nUnder  the  whole-person  concept,  the  administrative  judge  must  evaluate  an \\n \\napplicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s \\nconduct  and  all  relevant  circumstances.  The  administrative  judge  should  consider  the \\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d):  \\n \\n\\nthe  conduct, \\n\\nis  voluntary;  (6) \\n\\nthe  nature,  extent,  and  seriousness  of \\nto \\n\\nthe \\nthe  conduct;  (2) \\n(1) \\ncircumstances  surrounding \\ninclude  knowledgeable \\nparticipation;  (3)  the  frequency  and  recency  of  the  conduct;  (4)  the \\nindividual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \\nwhich  participation \\nthe  presence  or  absence  of \\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \\nfor  the  conduct;  (8)  the  potential  for  pressure,  coercion,  exploitation,  or \\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \\n \\n \\nUnder  AG ¶  2(c), the  ultimate  determination  of  whether to  grant  eligibility  for a \\nsecurity  clearance  must  be  an  overall  commonsense  judgment  based  upon  careful \\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \\n \\n\\nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines B and C in my whole-person \\nanalysis.  After  weighing  the  disqualifying  and  mitigating  conditions  under  both \\nguidelines,  and  evaluating  all  the  evidence  in  the  context  of  the  whole  person,  I \\nconclude  Applicant  has  mitigated  the  foreign  influence  and  foreign  preference \\nsecurity  concerns.  Accordingly,  I  conclude  he  has  carried  his  burden  of  showing \\nthat  it  is  clearly  consistent  with  the  national  interest  to  continue  his  eligibility  for \\naccess to classified information. \\n\\n \\n\\nFormal Findings \\n\\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \\n\\n \\n \\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\nParagraph 1, Guideline C:   \\nSubparagraph 1.a:   \\n \\nParagraph 2, Guideline B:   \\nSubparagraphs 2.a - 2.b: \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\nFor Applicant \\nFor Applicant \\nFor Applicant \\nFor Applicant \\n\\nConclusion \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nIn  light  of  all  of  the  circumstances  presented  by  the  record  in  this  case,  it  is \\nclearly  consistent  with  the  national  interest  to  continue  Applicant’s  eligibility  for  a \\nsecurity clearance.

On  November  3,  2014,  the  Department  of  Defense \\nConsolidated  Adjudications  Facility  (DODCAF)  issued  Applicant  a  Statement  of \\nReasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guidelines F and E. The  action was \\ntaken  under  Executive  Order  10865,  Safeguarding  Classified  Information  Within \\nIndustry  (February  20,  1960),  as  amended;  Department  of  Defense  Directive  5220.6, \\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \\namended  (Directive);  and  the  adjudicative  guidelines  (AG)  effective  within  the \\nDepartment of Defense on September 1, 2006.  \\n\\n \\nApplicant  answered  the  SOR  in  writing  on  December  8,  2014.  Applicant \\n\\nrequested his case be decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.  \\n\\n \\nOn April 17, 2015, Department Counsel submitted the Department=s written case. \\nA complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM), consisting of Items 1 to 7, was \\n\\n \\n1 \\n \\n \\n\\n\n",

Applicant \\nreceived the FORM on September 14, 2015.  \\n\\n \\nApplicant  did  not  file  a  Response  to  the  FORM  within  the  30  day  time  allowed \\n\\nthat would have expired on October 14, 2015.  \\n\\n \\nI  received  the  case assignment on  November  5,  2015. Based  upon  a  review  of \\n\\nthe pleadings and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \\n\\n \\n\\nFindings of Fact \\n\\n \\n\\nApplicant admitted   allegations in Subparagraphs 1.a to 1.g , then fails to admit \\nor deny 1.h, and 1i., then admits and disputes 1.j to 1.m, and fails to admit or deny 1.n \\nto 1.q. in Paragraph 1 concerning financial debts. He admitted the 10 allegations under \\nParagraph  2  alleging  20  personal  conduct  security  violations.  He  further  stated  in  his \\nAnswer  that  Subparagraphs  1.d  to  1.h  were  ”investigated  by  management”  without \\ndisclosing the results of those investigations. (Items 1-7)  \\n\\n \\nApplicant  is  35  years  old,  married  having  been  previously  divorced,  and  has \\nthree children and one stepchild. He works as a security guard for a defense contractor. \\nApplicant served in the U.S. Marines from 1998 to 2002. (Items 2-4) \\n \\n \\nApplicant  owes  $129,524  for  these  17  delinquent  debts.  His  Answer  states  he \\npaid  five  debts  (Subparagraphs  1.c,  1.e,  1.h,  1.i,  1.o),  has  installment  agreements  for \\nsix other debts (Subparagraphs 1.a, 1b, 1.d, 1.g, 1.n, 1.p, and 1.q), and is disputing four \\nother  debts  (Subparagraphs  1.j  to  1.m).  The  debt  to  an  insurance  company  in \\nSubparagraph 1.f he simply admits with no other explanation. The earliest debt is dated \\nin 2004.  (Items 1-7) \\n \\n \\nApplicant’s  Personal  Financial  Statement  submitted  with  his  interrogatory \\nanswers  states  his  2004  divorce  and  physical  injury  in  2010  caused  his  financial \\ndifficulties, but they are  “turning around” now. Applicant did not submit any documents \\nto support his SOR answers that debts are paid or being paid on the installment basis. \\nHe did not submit any dispute letters on other debts. He did not respond to the FORM. \\n(Items 1-7) \\n \\n \\nApplicant has numerous violations on his work record for his employer, for whom \\nhe has worked since 2004. Applicant had non-medical call-offs between 2004 and 2013, \\ntardiness in the same time, and several counseling sessions. The counseling pertained \\nto  his  possession  of  a  personal  cell  phone  at  the  work  site,  conducting  personal \\nbusiness on a government telephone, having a beverage at the work site, failing to sign \\nin after a meal break, failure to maintain his uniform, failure to execute his duties when \\nhe did not take a key inventory, failure to sign a schedule receipt for four hours of hold \\nover work he performed, failure to park a work vehicle in the correct location for which a \\n\\n \\n\\n2 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "parking ticket was issued to his employer, failure to sign into work, failure to hand carry \\na  package  to  the  addressee  that  resulted  in  a  processing  delay,  and  allowing  an \\nunauthorized  vehicle  to  gain  access  to  a  facility  without  properly  obtaining  valid \\nidentification  from  the  driver  and  vehicle  inspection  in  December  2006.  Applicant \\nreceived  a  letter  of  suspension  in  May  2006.  In  October  2006  he  received  a  two  day \\nsuspension.  In  December  2006  termination  was  started,  in  September  2011  Applicant \\nwas suspended for two days after having a cell phone at the work site, and in February \\n2012  he  received  a  one  day  suspension for  being  tardy  for  work  four  times.  Applicant \\nadmitted  all  these  violations  with  the  notation  on  the  disciplinary  accusations  that \\n“management investigated” them. (Items 1-7) \\n \\n \\nApplicant’s file contains several hundred pages of documents listing his violations \\nas  alleged  in  the  SOR  and  the  disciplinary  action  taken  by  his  employer.  These \\ndocuments support each SOR allegation. (Item 4) \\n  \\n\\n     Applicant  did  not  submit  any  documentation  that  he  has  participated  in  credit \\ncounseling or budget education. He provided no evidence concerning the quality of his \\njob  performance.  He  submitted  no  character  references  or  other  evidence  tending  to \\nestablish  good  judgment,  trustworthiness,  or  reliability.  I  was  unable  to  evaluate  his \\ncredibility, demeanor, or character in person since he elected to have his case decided \\nwithout a hearing. \\n \\n\\nPolicies \\n\\n \\n\\nWhen  evaluating  an  applicant=s  suitability \\n\\nthe \\nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \\nintroductory  explanations  for  each  guideline,  the  adjudicative  guidelines  list  potentially \\ndisqualifying  conditions  and  mitigating  conditions,  which  are  useful  in  evaluating  an \\napplicant=s eligibility for access to classified information. \\n\\nfor  a  security  clearance, \\n\\n \\nThese  guidelines  are  not  inflexible  rules  of  law.  Instead,  recognizing  the \\ncomplexities  of  human  behavior,  the  administrative  judge  applies  the  guidelines  in \\nconjunction  with  the  factors  listed  in  AG  ¶  2  describing  the  adjudicative  process.  The \\nadministrative \\nimpartial,  and \\ncommonsense decision. According to AG  & 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious \\nscrutiny  of  a  number  of  variables  known  as  the  Awhole-person  concept.@  The \\nadministrative  judge  must  consider  all  available,  reliable  information  about  the  person, \\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \\n\\njudge=s  overarching  adjudicative  goal \\n\\nis  a \\n\\nfair, \\n\\n \\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG & 2(b) \\nrequires  that  A[a]ny  doubt  concerning  personnel  being  considered  for  access  to \\nclassified  information  will  be  resolved  in  favor  of  national  security.@  In  reaching  this \\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \\nthe evidence contained in the record.  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n3 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "According  to  Directive  &  E3.1.14,  the  Government  must  present  evidence  to \\nestablish  controverted  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  Under  Directive  &  E3.1.15,  an \\n“applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \\nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \\nand  has  the  ultimate  burden  of  persuasion  as  to  obtaining  a  favorable  clearance \\ndecision.”  \\n\\nthe  Government  predicated  upon \\n\\n \\nA  person  who  seeks  access  to  classified  information  enters  into  a  fiduciary \\nrelationship  with \\ntrust  and  confidence.  This \\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \\nGovernment  reposes  a  high  degree  of  trust  and  confidence  in  individuals  to  whom  it \\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \\nthe  possible  risk  the  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  protect  or \\nsafeguard  classified  information.  Such  decisions  entail  a  certain  degree  of  legally \\npermissible  extrapolation  as  to  potential,  rather  than  actual,  risk  of  compromise  of \\nclassified information. See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \\n \\n\\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \\n \\n\\nAnalysis \\n\\n \\n\\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \\n\\nout in AG & 18:       \\n \\n\\nFailure  or  inability  to  live  within  one=s  means,  satisfy  debts,  and  meet \\nfinancial  obligations  may  indicate  poor  self-control,  lack  of  judgment,  or \\nunwillingness  to  abide  by  rules  and  regulations,  all  of  which  can  raise \\nquestions  about  an  individual=s  reliability,  trustworthiness  and  ability  to \\nprotect  classified \\nfinancially \\noverextended  is  at  risk  of  having  to  engage  in  illegal  acts  to  generate \\nfunds.  \\n\\ninformation.  An \\n\\nindividual  who \\n\\nis \\n\\n \\n\\nThe guideline at AG & 19 contains nine disqualifying conditions that could raise \\nsecurity concerns. From these nine conditions, two conditions are applicable to the facts \\nfound in this case: \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and   \\n \\n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \\n \\n \\nFrom  2004  to  the  present,  Applicant  accumulated  17  delinquent  debts,  totaling \\n$129,524 that remain unpaid or unresolved. Applicant has not shown clearly what debts \\nhe paid or is paying beyond his mere statements in his Answer. Without supporting and \\nwell-organized  documentation  addressing  each  of  the  allegations  specifically  the  true \\n\\n \\n\\n4 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n\n",
       " \\nstatus of his debts cannot be known. An in-depth review of the Items in the file shows \\nno support for his alleged payments.  \\n \\n\\nThe  guideline  in  AG  ¶  20  contains  six  conditions  that  could  mitigate  security \\nconcerns  arising  from  financial  difficulties.  Only  one  mitigating  condition  might  have \\npartial applicability. \\n\\n \\n\\n(b)  the  conditions  that  resulted  in  the  financial  problem  were  largely \\nbeyond  the  person's  control  (e.g.,  loss  of  employment,  a  business \\ndownturn,  unexpected  medical  emergency,  or  a  death,  divorce  or \\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. \\n\\n \\n\\nAG ¶ 20 (b) would apply if his divorce 11 years ago adversely affected his ability \\nto repay his debts. But he also has to act responsibly under the circumstances. It is his \\nburden  of  proof  to  submit  specific  documents  to  demonstrate  those  actions.  However, \\nhe failed to meet his burden of proof on that issue.  \\n\\n \\nLastly,  Applicant  contends  his  medical  problem  in  2010  caused  some  of  his \\ndelinquent debt. Applicant failed to prove AG ¶ 20 (b) applied because he did not submit \\nsufficient evidence of the conditions that he asserted were beyond his control and that \\nhe  acted  responsibly  in  resolving  his  delinquent  debts  during  the  time  the  debts  were \\naccumulating. \\n\\n \\n\\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \\n\\n \\nAG ¶ 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \\n \\nConduct  involving  questionable  judgment,  lack  of  candor,  dishonesty,  or \\nunwillingness  to  comply  with  rules  and  regulations  can  raise  questions \\nabout  an  individual's  reliability,  trustworthiness  and  ability  to  protect \\nclassified  information.  Of  special  interest  is  any  failure  to  provide  truthful \\nand  candid  answers  during  the  security  clearance  process  or  any  other \\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \\n \\nAG  ¶  16  describes  conditions  that  could  raise  a  security  concern  and  may  be \\n\\ndisqualifying: \\n\\n \\n (c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \\nnot  sufficient  for  an  adverse  determination  under  any  other  single \\nguideline,  but  which,  when  considered  as  a  whole,  supports  a  whole-\\nperson  assessment  of  questionable \\njudgment,  untrustworthiness, \\nunreliability,  lack  of  candor,  unwillingness  to  comply  with  rules  and \\nregulations,  or  other  characteristics  indicating  that  the  person  may  not \\nproperly safeguard protected information; \\n\\n \\n\\n5 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n\n",
       " \\n\\n(d)  credible  adverse  information  that  is  not  explicitly  covered  under  any \\nother  guideline  and  may  not  be  sufficient  by  itself  for  an  adverse \\ndetermination,  but  which,  when  combined  with  all  available  information \\nsupports  a  whole-person  assessment  of  questionable \\njudgment, \\nuntrustworthiness,  unreliability,  lack  of  candor,  unwillingness  to  comply \\nwith  rules  and  regulations,  or  other  characteristics  indicating  that  the \\nperson  may  not  properly  safeguard  protected  information.  This  includes \\nbut is not limited to consideration of: \\n \\n\\n(1)  untrustworthy  or  unreliable  behavior  to  include  breach  of  client \\nconfidentiality,  release  of  proprietary  information, unauthorized  release of \\nsensitive corporate or other government protected information: \\n \\n\\n(2)  disruptive,  violent,  or  other  inappropriate  behavior  in  the \\n\\nworkplace;  \\n \\n\\n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations;  \\n\\n \\n\\n(4)  evidence  of  significant  misuse  of  Government  or  other \\n\\nemployer's time or resources; and \\n \\n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \\nthat  creates  a  vulnerability  to  exploitation,  manipulation,  or  duress,  such \\nas  (1)  engaging  in  activities  which,  if  known,  may  affect  the  person's \\npersonal,  professional,  or  community  standing,  or  (2)  while  in  another \\ncountry,  engaging  in  any  activity  that  is  illegal  in  that  country  or  that  is \\nlegal  in  that  country  but  illegal  in  the  United  States  and  may  serve  as  a \\nbasis  for  exploitation  or  pressure  by  the  foreign  security  or  intelligence \\nservice or other group; \\n \\nApplicant  committed  numerous  acts  of  inappropriate  conduct  in  the  work  place, \\nexhibited  a pattern of dishonesty  and  rule  violations,  and  misused  his  employer’s  time \\nand resources to a significant degree, as shown by the continuing pattern of misconduct \\nfrom  2004  to  2014.  AG  ¶  16  (c)  and  (d)  apply  to  the  totality  of  Applicant’s  repeated \\nviolations and failure to conform his behavior to expected standards of conduct.  \\n\\n \\nApplicant’s  personal  conduct,  which  consists  of  a  number  repeated  and \\nsignificant  violations  of  company  policies,  creates  a  vulnerability  to  exploitation, \\nmanipulation, or duress because of the frequency and nature of the incidents. Coupled \\nwith his financial debts, Applicant is especially vulnerable to coercion and duress in the \\nhope of extricating himself from his predicament caused by his misconduct and financial \\ndelinquencies. AG ¶ 16 (e) is established.  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n6 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n\n",
       " \\n\\nAG  ¶  17  provides  seven  conditions  that  could  mitigate  security  concerns.  A \\nreview of each shows that none apply in this Applicant’s case. His offenses are a series \\nof  transgressions  that  show  an  inattention  to  the  requirements  of  his  position,  casting \\ndoubt  on  his  reliability,  trustworthiness,  and  good  judgment.  AG  ¶  17  (c)  is  not \\nestablished.  \\n \\n\\nApplicant has not acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change \\nhis actions or taken other positive steps to show his course of conduct will not recur. AG \\n¶ 17 (d) does not apply.  \\n \\n\\nApplicant  has  not  taken  positive  action  to  reduce  or  eliminate  vulnerability  to \\n\\nexploitation, manipulation, or duress. AG ¶ 17 (e) is not established.  \\n \\n\\nThe information is substantiated in many documents submitted in the Applicant’s \\n\\nfile. AG ¶ 17 (f) is not established.  \\n \\n\\nFinally, there is no allegation that Applicant associated with persons involved with \\ncriminal  activity,  so  AG  ¶17  (g)  is  not  applicable.  Nor  are  the  first  two  mitigating \\nconditions of any applicability because they apply to false statements by any Applicant \\nor failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \\n \\nWhole-Person Concept \\n\\n \\nUnder  the  whole-person  concept,  the  administrative  judge  must  evaluate  an \\napplicant=s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant=s \\nconduct  and  all  relevant  circumstances.  The  administrative  judge  should  consider  the \\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG & 2(a): \\n\\nthe  nature,  extent,  and  seriousness  of \\nto \\n\\n \\nthe \\nthe  conduct;  (2) \\n(1) \\ncircumstances  surrounding \\ninclude  knowledgeable \\nparticipation;  (3)  the  frequency  and  recency  of  the  conduct;  (4)  the \\nindividual=s  age  and  maturity  at  the  time  of  the  conduct;  (5)  the extent to \\nwhich  participation \\nthe  presence  or  absence  of \\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \\nfor  the  conduct;  (8)  the  potential  for  pressure,  coercion,  exploitation,  or \\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \\n \\n\\nthe  conduct, \\n\\nis  voluntary;  (6) \\n\\nUnder AG & 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \\nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.      \\n\\n \\n\\nI  considered  the  potentially  disqualifying  and  mitigating  conditions  in  light  of  all \\nfacts  and  circumstances  surrounding  this  case.  Applicant  was  an  adult  when  he \\nincurred  the  debts.  He  has  not  taken  any  action  supported  by  objective  evidence  to \\n\\n \\n\\n7 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n\n",
       " \\nresolve his delinquent debts. This inaction leaves him vulnerable to pressure, coercion, \\nexploitation,  or  duress  based  on  the  magnitude  of  his  financial  obligation.  His  lack  of \\naction continues to this day, and is obviously voluntary. His inaction will continue based \\non  his  past  performance.  Applicant  displayed  a  lack  of  good  judgment  incurring  the \\ndebts.  Next,  he  exhibited  a  continued  lack  of  appropriate  judgment  by  failing  to  make \\npayments on any of his delinquent debts during the past seven years. \\n\\n \\nApplicant also has a pattern of violations of work standards set by his employer. \\nHe is an inattentive employee who finds it difficult to conform his behavior to the rules \\nand regulations of his employer. His misconduct has been perpetrated over a decade of \\nemployment. \\n\\n \\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or substantial doubts as to \\nApplicant=s  eligibility  and  suitability  for  a  security  clearance.  For  all  these  reasons,  I \\nconclude  Applicant  did  not  mitigate  the  security  concerns  arising  under  the  guidelines \\nfor Financial Considerations and Personal Conduct.  \\n \\n\\nFormal Findings \\n\\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \\n\\n \\n \\nas required by ¶ E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \\n \\n\\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \\n\\n \\n          Subparagraph 1.a to 1.q: \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:   \\n\\nSubparagraphs 2.a to 2.j:   \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nAGAINST APPLICANT \\n\\nAgainst Applicant \\n\\nAGAINST APPLICANT \\n\\nAgainst Applicant \\n\\nConclusion \\n\\n \\n\\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \\nclearly  consistent  with  the  national  interest  to  grant  Applicant  eligibility  for  a  security \\nclearance.

Eligibility \\n\\nfor access to classified information is denied.  \\n\\nStatement of the Case \\n\\nOn  June  16,  2015,  the  Department  of  Defense  Consolidated  Adjudications \\nFacility (DOD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \\nconcerns  under  Guideline  G,  alcohol  consumption.  DOD  CAF  acted  under  Executive \\nOrder  (EO)  10865,  Safeguarding  Classified  Information  within  Industry  (February  20, \\n1960),  as  amended;  DOD  Directive  5220.6,  Defense  Industrial  Personnel  Security \\nClearance  Review  Program  (January  2,  1992),  as  amended  (Directive);  and  the \\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on September 1, 2006. \\n\\n \\nApplicant  answered  the  SOR  on  July  14,  2015,  and  elected  to  have  his  case \\ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the \\nGovernment’s File of Relevant Material (FORM) on September 9, 2015. The evidence \\n\\n) \\n) \\n) \\n) \\n) \\n) \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n1 \\n \\n \\n\\n\f",
       "included in the FORM is identified as Items 4-10 and is admitted into the record (Items \\n1-3 are pleadings and transmittal documents). The FORM was mailed to Applicant, who \\nreceived it on October 19, 2015. Applicant was given an opportunity to file objections \\nand submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. He submitted an undated \\nresponse to the FORM, which was admitted without objection as Applicant Exhibit (AE) \\nA. The case was assigned to me on December 21, 2015.  \\n\\nIn Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted all but one of the allegations. The \\nadmissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a careful review of the pleadings and \\nevidence, I make the following additional findings of fact.1 \\n\\n \\nApplicant is 56 years old. He has worked for a defense contractor since 1997. He \\nis divorced and has three children, ages 15, 18, and 20. He has a bachelor’s degree. He \\nhas no military experience.2  \\n \\n \\n \\nApplicant’s conduct raised in the SOR included: a history of consuming alcohol, \\nat times, to excess from 1974 to about April 2014; being found guilty for operating under \\nthe  influence  of  alcohol  (OUI)  in  February  1991;  being  found  guilty  for  OUI  2nd  in \\nNovember 1997; and being found guilty for OUI 3rd in November 2010 (See SOR ¶¶ 1.a \\n- 1.d).3 \\n \\n \\nApplicant  began  drinking  alcohol  when  he  was  approximately  15  years  old  in \\n1974. He drinks beer on most occasions. Even after his OUI convictions, he stated he \\nwas  still  was  consuming  two  to  three  beers  a  week.  He  drinks  in  social  settings  and \\nafter hockey games. As a result of his 2010 OUI conviction, he lost his driver’s license \\nfor five years. He completed his probation in May 2015.4 \\n \\n \\nCourt documents establish that Applicant was found guilty of three OUI offenses, \\nin 1992 (1991 arrest), 2000 (1997 arrest), and 2012 (2010 arrest). He was placed on \\nprobation in each instance.5 \\n \\n \\nIn  February  1991,  Applicant  was  driving  home  from  a  friend’s  house  where  he \\nconsumed  about  four  beers.  He  was  stopped  by  a  police  officer  who  had  observed \\nApplicant’s  car  cross  over  the  center  line.  Applicant  was  given,  and  failed,  a  field \\nsobriety test. He was taken into the police station where he refused a breathalyzer test. \\n                                                           \\n1 Item 2. \\n \\n2 Item 4. \\n \\n3 Items 1, 3. \\n \\n4 Item 10; AE A. \\n \\n5 Item 7, 9; AE A. \\n \\n\\n \\n\\nFindings of Fact \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n2 \\n \\n \\n\\n\f",
       "He was charged with OUI and later pleaded guilty. He was required to attend 12 weeks \\nof alcohol education and counseling classes, which he completed.6 \\n \\n \\nIn November 1997, Applicant was going home from a high school football game \\nwhen he was stopped in traffic by a police officer. Applicant had two beers before the \\ngame  and  shared  a  flask  containing  some  kind  of  alcohol  at  the  game.  The  officer \\napparently  asked  Applicant \\nif  he  had  been  drinking  and  Applicant  answered \\naffirmatively. He was then given field sobriety tests, which he failed. He was arrested, \\ntaken back to the police station and given a breathalyzer test, which he also failed. He \\nwas  found  guilty  of  OUI  and  sentenced  to  two  years’  probation,  loss  of  his  driver’s \\nlicense  for  six  months,  and  12  weeks  required  attendance  at  alcohol  education  and \\ncounseling classes.7 \\n \\n \\nIn  November  2010,  Applicant  was  driving  back  from  a  hockey  tournament  and \\nwas stopped by a state patrolman because he crossed the center line. Applicant had \\nconsumed six beers and shared a flask of whiskey at the hockey tournament. He failed \\nthe  field  sobriety  tests  and  was  almost  incoherent  to  the  patrolman.  He  was  arrested \\nand taken to a police station where he was offered a breathalyzer test. He was unable \\nto properly perform the test, which was deemed a refusal to take the test. He was found \\nguilty of OUI and sentenced to six months’ incarceration, five years of probation, loss of \\ndriver’s  license  for  five  years,  and  mandatory  substance  abuse  evaluation  and \\ntreatment.8 \\n \\nThe court-ordered substance abuse treatment involved two mandatory sessions \\n \\nand  Applicant  voluntarily  attended  six  more  sessions.  He \\nto  provide \\ndocumentation of any evaluation done by the counselors, but Applicant stated he was \\ndiagnosed  as  being  an  alcohol  abuser.  Applicant  also  attended  Alcohol  Anonymous \\n(AA) meetings once every six to eight weeks. He last attended an AA meeting in May \\n2015. He continued to drink an occasional beer every few months. In May 2015, at an \\nAA meeting he heard a story had made him decide to stop drinking alcohol entirely. He \\nclaims he has not had any alcohol since that time.9 \\n \\n\\nfailed \\n\\nfor  a  security  clearance, \\n\\nWhen  evaluating  an  applicant’s  suitability \\n\\n \\nthe \\nadministrative  judge  must  consider  the  adjudicative  guidelines.  In  addition  to  brief \\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \\ndisqualifying  conditions  and  mitigating  conditions,  which  are  used  in  evaluating  an \\napplicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. \\n                                                           \\n6 Item 10. \\n \\n7 Item 10. \\n \\n8 Items 7, 10. \\n \\n9 Item 6-10; AE A. \\n \\n\\nPolicies \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n3 \\n \\n \\n\\n\f",
       "These  guidelines  are  not  inflexible  rules  of  law.  Instead,  recognizing  the \\ncomplexities  of  human  behavior,  these  guidelines  are  applied  in  conjunction  with  the \\nfactors  listed  in  the  adjudicative  process.  The  administrative  judge’s  overarching \\nadjudicative  goal  is  a  fair,  impartial,  and  commonsense  decision.  According  to  AG  ¶ \\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \\nthe  “whole-person  concept.”  The  administrative  judge  must  consider  all  available, \\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \\nmaking a decision. \\n\\n \\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) \\nrequires  that  “[a]ny  doubt  concerning  personnel  being  considered  for  access  to \\nclassified  information  will  be  resolved  in  favor  of  national  security.”  In  reaching  this \\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \\non the evidence contained in the record.  \\n\\n \\nUnder Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \\ncontroverted  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  Under  Directive  ¶  E3.1.15,  an  “applicant  is \\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \\nmitigate  facts  admitted  by  applicant  or  proven  by  Department  Counsel,  and  has  the \\nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.”  \\n\\nthe  Government  predicated  upon \\n\\n \\nA  person  who  seeks  access  to  classified  information  enters  into  a  fiduciary \\nrelationship  with \\ntrust  and  confidence.  This \\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \\nGovernment  reposes  a  high  degree  of  trust  and  confidence  in  individuals  to  whom  it \\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \\nthe  possible  risk  that  an  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  safeguard \\nclassified  information.  Such  decisions  entail  a  certain  degree  of  legally  permissible \\nextrapolation  about  potential,  rather  than  actual,  risk  of  compromise  of  classified \\ninformation. \\n\\n \\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of \\nthe national interest and shall  in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \\napplicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \\n\\nAnalysis \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \\n\\nAG ¶ 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption: \\n\\nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \\njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \\nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \\n\\n \\n4 \\n \\n \\n\\n\f",
       "AG  ¶  22  describes  conditions  that  could  raise  a  security  concern  and  may  be \\n\\ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \\n\\n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \\nthe  influence,  fighting,  child  or  spouse  abuse,  disturbing  the  peace,  or \\nother  incidents  of  concern,  regardless  of  whether  the  individual  is \\ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent;  \\n\\n(c)  habitual  or  binge  consumption  of  alcohol  to  the  point  of  impaired \\njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol \\nabuser or alcohol dependent. \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\nof both disqualifying conditions.  \\n\\nApplicant’s three OUI convictions and his drinking history support the application \\n\\nI  have  also  considered  all  of  the  mitigating  conditions  for  alcohol  consumption \\n\\nunder AG ¶ 23 and found the following relevant: \\n\\n(a)  so  much  time  has  passed,  or  the  behavior  was  so  infrequent,  or  it \\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \\nor good judgment; and \\n\\n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol \\nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \\nhas  established  a  pattern  of  abstinence  (if  alcohol  dependent)  or \\nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser). \\n\\n \\nApplicant’s  last  adverse  alcohol  incident  occurred  in  November  2010  and  he \\ncame  off  probation  for  that  offense  in  May  2015.  His  three  OUI  convictions  are  not \\ninfrequent  under  these  circumstances.  Insufficient  attenuation  exists  to  conclude \\nenough  time  has  passed  since  his  last  alcohol-related  incident.  His  history  of  OUI \\narrests  and  convictions  under  similar  circumstances  suggest  that  recurrence  is  a \\npossibility. His current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment are in doubt. AG ¶ \\n23(a) does not apply. \\n \\nApplicant recently decided to totally abstain from using alcohol. He indicated that \\n \\nhe has abstained since May 2015. While this is a commendable start, it is too soon to \\ndetermine whether his abstinence will continue to be part of his life or whether he will \\nuse alcohol responsibly in the future. AG ¶ 23(b) partially applies.   \\n \\nWhole-Person Concept \\n \\nUnder  the  whole-person  concept,  the  administrative  judge  must  evaluate  an \\n \\napplicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s \\n\\n \\n5 \\n \\n \\n\\n\f",
       "conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  \\n \\n\\nthe  conduct, \\n\\nthe  nature,  extent,  and  seriousness  of \\nto \\n\\n(1) \\nthe  conduct;  (2) \\nthe \\ncircumstances  surrounding \\ninclude  knowledgeable \\nparticipation;  (3)  the  frequency  and  recency  of  the  conduct;  (4)  the \\nindividual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \\nwhich  participation \\nthe  presence  or  absence  of \\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \\nfor  the  conduct;  (8)  the  potential  for  pressure,  coercion,  exploitation,  or \\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \\n \\n\\nis  voluntary;  (6) \\n\\nUnder AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \\nof the guideline and the whole-person concept.        \\n\\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered the circumstances that \\nled  to  his  arrests  and  his  current  state  of  abstinence.  Overall,  the  record  evidence \\nleaves  me  with  questions  and  doubts  as  to  Applicant’s  eligibility  and  suitability  for  a \\nsecurity  clearance.  For  all  these  reasons,  I  conclude  Applicant  failed  to  mitigate  the \\nsecurity concerns under Guideline G. \\n\\nFormal Findings \\n\\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \\n\\n \\n \\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \\n \\n \\n \\n\\nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.d: \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nAgainst Applicant \\n\\nAGAINST APPLICANT \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nConclusion \\n\\n \\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \\nclearly  consistent  with  the  national  interest  to  grant  Applicant  eligibility  for  a  security \\nclearance.

Eligibility  for \\n\\naccess to classified information is granted.  \\n \\n\\nStatement of the Case \\n\\nOn October 28, 2014, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \\nReasons  (SOR)  to  Applicant  detailing  security  concerns  under  Guideline  F,  financial \\nconsiderations. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \\n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \\n1992),  as  amended  (Directive);  and  the  adjudicative  guidelines  (AG)  implemented  by \\nthe DOD on September 1, 2006. \\n\\n \\nApplicant  responded  to  the  SOR  on  November  14,  2014,  and  requested  a \\nhearing  before  an  administrative  judge.  The  case  was  originally  assigned  to  me  on \\nFebruary 27, 2015. Scheduling of the case was delayed because Applicant was working \\noverseas. The case was reassigned to me on May 4, 2015. After coordinating with the \\nparties, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n1 \\n\\n\f",
       "on  July  16,  2015,  scheduling  the  hearing  for  August  18,  2015.  The  hearing  was \\nconvened  as  scheduled.  DOHA  received  the  hearing  transcript  (Tr.)  on  August  26, \\n2015.  \\n \\n\\nEvidentiary Rulings \\n\\nGovernment  Exhibits  (GE)  1,  2,  4,  5,  and  6  were  admitted  in  evidence  without \\nobjection. GE 3 was admitted over Applicant’s objection. Applicant testified, called five \\nwitnesses, and submitted Applicant’s Exhibits (AE) A through Z, which were admitted \\nwithout  objection.  The  record  was  held  open  for  Applicant  to  submit  additional \\ninformation. He submitted documents that I have marked AE AA and BB1 and admitted \\nwithout objection.  \\n \\n\\nFindings of Fact \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\nApplicant is a 57-year-old self-employed contractor for a defense contractor. He \\nserved  in  the  U.S.  military  from  1979  until  he  retired  in  2000.  He  seeks  to  retain  a \\nsecurity clearance, which he has held since he was in the military. He attended college \\nfor a period, but he is a few credits shy of a degree. His first marriage ended in divorce. \\nHe has been married to his current spouse for more than 25 years. He has two adult \\nchildren.2 \\n \\n \\nApplicant spent the majority of his military career in special operations. He went \\non  numerous  combat  missions,  conducted  clandestine  insertions,  and  operated \\nundercover.  When  he  retired  he  became  an  entrepreneur  and  started  his  own \\ncompanies.  His  primary  company  was  incorporated,  but  Applicant  had  to  personally \\nguarantee many of the company’s liabilities. He also invested in real estate. His primary \\ncompany  suffered  significant  setbacks  during  the  recession  and  housing  crisis  of  the \\nlater part of the 2000s. His real estate properties lost much of their value. He closed his \\nprimary  company  in  2009  and  has  been  working  since  then  as  a  self-employed \\ncontractor and subcontractor for other companies. He has spent much of the last five \\nyears working overseas in dangerous assignments.3 \\n \\n  \\nThe SOR alleges nine delinquent debts, which include a $58,161 judgment (SOR \\n¶  1.a),  mortgage  loans  (SOR  ¶  1.c  -  $30,994;  SOR  ¶  1.d  -  $351,562;  SOR  ¶  1.e  - \\n$271,900; and SOR ¶ 1.f - $50,688), two business-related debts (SOR ¶ 1.b - $18,028 \\nand SOR ¶ 1.h - $77,115) and federal taxes (SOR ¶ 1.g - $33,882 for tax year 2008, \\nand SOR ¶ 1.i – no amount alleged for tax years 2012 and 2013). Applicant admitted \\nowing most of the debts at some point, but several of the debts were paid, settled, or \\notherwise resolved. \\n \\n\\n                                                           \\n1  Counsel  marked  the  post-hearing  submissions  as  Z  and  AA,  but  AE  Z  was  already  admitted  at  the \\nhearing.  \\n \\n2 Tr. at 118, 123-127, 184; GE 1, 3 AE A. \\n \\n3 Tr. at 28-31, 120, 127-131; GE 1, 3; AE A, T. \\n\\n \\n2 \\n\\n\f",
       " \\nApplicant’s primary company was growing, and it leased a larger warehouse in \\nabout  2008.  The  business  ultimately  failed,  and  the  company  broke  the  lease.  The \\nowner of the warehouse sued  Applicant  personally  and  obtained a $58,161 judgment \\nagainst  him  (SOR  ¶  1.a).  Applicant’s  attorney  is  negotiating  a  settlement  on  this \\njudgment.4  \\n \\n \\nApplicant and a partner had a falling out over the business. The ex-partner sued \\nApplicant  for  $160,000.  They  reached  a  settlement  through  arbitration  in  which \\nApplicant agreed to pay the ex-partner $163,000 by 2010. He paid about $86,000, but \\nhe  was  unable  to  pay  the  remainder  when  the  company  closed.  The  partner  either \\nobtained  a  judgment  for  $77,000  or  sought  to  enforce  the  arbitrated  settlement. \\nApplicant’s  attorney  is  negotiating  a  settlement  for  the  remainder  owed  to  the  ex-\\npartner.5 \\n \\nIn February 2013, Applicant settled the $20,302 business credit card debt alleged \\n \\nin  SOR  ¶  1.b  (alleged  as  $18,028  in  SOR)  for  $10,151,  which  was  paid  in  February \\n2013. Applicant submitted proof in his response to DOHA interrogatories in May 2014 \\nthat the debt had been settled. The February 2014 credit report lists the account with a \\nzero balance, with the annotation that it was transferred, sold, and paid.6 \\n \\n \\nApplicant was due a refund from his 2007 federal income taxes, but he owed the \\nIRS for tax year 2008. The IRS filed a $33,882 tax lien against Applicant in June 2010 \\n(SOR ¶ 1.g). In January 2011, the IRS applied his $15,892 refund from his 2007 taxes \\nto his 2008 taxes.

Instead,  recognizing  the \\ncomplexities  of  human  behavior,  administrative  judges  apply  the  guidelines  in \\nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s \\noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \\nto  AG  ¶  2(c),  the  entire  process  is  a  conscientious  scrutiny  of  a  number  of  variables \\nknown  as  the  “whole-person  concept.”  The  administrative  judge  must  consider  all \\navailable,  reliable  information  about  the  person,  past  and  present,  favorable  and \\nunfavorable, in making a decision. \\n\\n \\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) \\nrequires  that  “[a]ny  doubt  concerning  personnel  being  considered  for  access  to \\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.”  \\n\\n \\nUnder Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \\ncontroverted  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  Under  Directive  ¶  E3.1.15,  the  applicant  is \\nresponsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \\nor  mitigate  facts  admitted  by  the  applicant  or  proven  by  Department  Counsel.”  The \\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \\n\\nthe  Government  predicated  upon \\n\\n \\nA  person  who  seeks  access  to  classified  information  enters  into  a  fiduciary \\n \\nrelationship  with \\ntrust  and  confidence.  This \\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \\nGovernment  reposes  a  high  degree  of  trust  and  confidence  in  individuals  to  whom  it \\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \\nthe  possible  risk  the  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  safeguard \\nclassified  information.  Such  decisions  entail  a  certain  degree  of  legally  permissible \\n                                                           \\n14 Tr. at 50, 180-181, 190-193, 197; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 3 ; AE A, U, W, Y. \\n \\n15 Tr. at 25-28, 50-51, 62-74; AE B-L, T. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n5 \\n\\n\f",

The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \\n\\n \\n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \\n\\n \\n\\n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\nevidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions.  \\n \\n  \\nprovided under AG ¶ 20.

Additionally, the SOR alleged the high credit on the two \\nmortgage  loans  (SOR  ¶¶  1.d  -  $351,562  and  1.e  -  $271,900),  when  the  balances  on \\nthose loans were reported as zero.  \\n \\n  \\nApplicant paid his 2008 federal income taxes. He has a payment plan in place for \\nhis  2012  and  2013  tax  years.  He  settled  and  paid  the  second  mortgage  loan  on  his \\nhome,  and  he  paid  other  debts  that  were  not  alleged  in  the  SOR.  His  attorney  is \\nnegotiating  settlements  for  the  two  judgments  against  him.  Applicant  credibly  testified \\nthat it will take time, but he is committed to resolving all his debts. \\n \\n \\nI find that Applicant established a plan to resolve his financial problems, and he \\ntook significant action to implement that plan. He acted responsibly and made a good-\\nfaith effort to pay his debts. There are clear indications that his financial problems are \\nbeing  resolved  and  are  under  control.  They  occurred  under  circumstances  that  are \\nunlikely  to  recur  and  do  not  cast  doubt  on  his  current  reliability,  trustworthiness,  and \\ngood judgment. AG ¶¶ 20(c) and 20(d) are applicable. AG ¶ 20(b) is partially applicable. \\nAG ¶ 20(a) is not yet completely applicable because Applicant is still in the process of \\npaying his debts.  \\n \\nWhole-Person Concept \\n \\nUnder  the  whole-person  concept,  the  administrative  judge  must  evaluate  an \\n \\napplicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s \\nconduct  and  all  relevant  circumstances.

       " \\nUnder AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \\nsecurity  clearance  must  be  an  overall  commonsense  judgment  based  upon  careful \\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \\n \\n\\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions  in  light  of  all \\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.

He  has  been  working  for  that  contractor  in  the  Middle  East \\nsince May 2011 and has worked overseas for other defense contractors for a number of \\nyears.  He  earned  a  general  educational  development  certificate  in  1996  and  an \\nassociate’s degree in 2003. He has been married twice. He married his current wife in \\n2005. He has three children, ages 15, 16, and 22.3 \\n \\n\\nExcluding  the  withdrawn  allegations,  the  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  had  three \\ndelinquent  debts  totaling  $64,168  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.c).  In  his  Answer  to  the  SOR,  he \\ndenied each debt. Substantial evidence of the alleged debts is contained in GE 1-4.4  \\n\\n \\nIn 1999, Applicant was involved in a car accident and incurred a broken pelvis \\nand hip. He was determined to be fully disabled and collected about $1,000 per month \\nin disability payments from the Social Security Administration (SSA). While receiving the \\ndisability benefits, he knew there was a limit on how much income he could earn, but \\ndid not know the exact restrictions. In 2006, he received a letter from SSA that indicated \\n                                                           \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n1 Tr. 23-25.  \\n\\n2 Tr. 43-44.  \\n\\n3 Tr. 5-7, 23, 37-39, 42-43; GE 1. \\n\\n4 GE 1-4; Applicant’s Answer to the SOR.  \\n\\n \\n2 \\n \\n \\n\\n\f",
       "he was earning more income than he was allowed. At that time, his disability payments \\nstopped, and he has not received any further disability payments since then.5 \\n\\n \\nA credit report dated June 12, 2010, reflected that Applicant’s SSA account had \\nbeen  placed  for  collection  in  the  amount  of  $20,955  (SOR  ¶  1.c).  This  delinquent \\naccount was the result of his overpayment of disability payments. In 2008, he started \\nrepaying this debt through a monthly pay allotment of $300. When he left his job later \\nthat year, the allotment stopped. In 2012, the SSA began garnishing his pay at a rate of \\n$600 every two weeks. By early 2014 (well before the issuance of the SOR), he fully \\nrepaid this debt. In July 2014, he received a letter from the SSA stating he overpaid the \\ndebt and would be receiving a refund of $2,535.6 \\n\\n \\nIn 2008 and 2009, Applicant worked overseas, and a portion of his income was \\nexempt from taxation. In those years, his income was greater than the exemption, and \\nhe incurred taxes that he could not pay. In his security clearance application (SCA), he \\ndisclosed that he owed approximately $36,000 to the IRS for 2008 and 2009 (SOR ¶ \\n1.b). In 2010, his state also filed a $7,213 tax lien against him (SOR ¶ 1.a).7 \\n\\n \\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant stated that the state tax lien had been repaid \\nthrough monthly payroll deductions. He also stated that he had a repayment plan with \\nthe IRS and the payments are automatically deducted from his pay.8  \\n\\n  \\nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that the state tax lien was repaid, but he had \\nnot  yet  received  a  document  from  the  state  showing  it  was  paid.  He  stated  that  the \\ndeductions from his pay for the state tax lien stopped over a year ago. At the hearing, \\nhe also provided IRS account transcripts for 2008 and 2009 that showed he had been \\nconsistently  making  monthly  payments  of  $375  since  August  2012.  As  of  September \\n2015,  his  IRS  account  balance  for  2008  was  $3,961  and  for  2009  was  $17,124.  The \\naccount transcripts showed that his IRS debt had been cut almost in half.9 \\n\\n  \\nBesides the debts alleged in the SOR, Applicant’s credit report dated March 26, \\n2015, reflected that he had no other delinquent debts. He also testified that he had no \\nother delinquent debts. In 2014, he earned about $108,000 and his wife earned about \\n$25,000.

Instead,  recognizing  the  complexities  of  human  behavior,  these  guidelines  are \\napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s \\nadjudicative  goal  is  a  fair,  impartial,  and  commonsense  decision.  An  administrative \\njudge  must  consider  all  available,  reliable  information  about  the  person,  past  and \\npresent, favorable and unfavorable, in reaching a decision.  \\n\\n \\nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \\naccess  to  classified  information.  This  relationship  transcends  normal  duty  hours  and \\nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \\npossible  risk  that  the  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  safeguard \\nclassified  information.  Such  decisions  entail  a  certain  degree  of  legally  permissible \\nextrapolation  of  potential,  rather  than  actual,  risk  of  compromise  of  classified \\ninformation. Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in \\nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. \\nOr.  10865  §  7.  See  also  Executive  Order  12968  (Aug.  2,  1995),  Section  3.  Thus,  a \\nclearance  decision  is  merely  an  indication  that  the  Applicant  has  or  has  not  met  the \\nstrict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing \\na clearance. \\n\\n \\nInitially,  the  Government  must  establish,  by  substantial  evidence,  conditions  in \\nthe  personal  or  professional  history  of  the  applicant  that  may  disqualify  the  applicant \\nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \\nof  establishing  controverted  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  See  Egan,  484  U.S.  at  531.  \\n“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. \\nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \\npresume  a  nexus  or  rational  connection  between  proven  conduct  under  any  of  the \\ncriteria listed and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \\n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n4 \\n \\n \\n\\n\f",
       "Once  the  Government  establishes  a  disqualifying  condition  by  substantial \\nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \\nfacts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \\nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue [his or her] security \\nclearance.”  ISCR  Case  No.  01-20700  at  3  (App.  Bd.  Dec.  19,  2002).  The  burden  of \\ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. \\n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \\nif they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   \\n\\nAnalysis \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \\n\\n \\nThe security concern for this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 18 as follows: \\n\\n \\n\\nFailure  or  inability  to  live  within  one’s  means,  satisfy  debts,  and  meet \\nfinancial  obligations  may  indicate  poor  self-control,  lack  of  judgment,  or \\nunwillingness  to  abide  by  rules  and  regulations,  all  of  which  can  raise \\nquestions  about  an  individual’s  reliability,  trustworthiness  and  ability  to \\nprotect  classified \\nfinancially \\noverextended  is  at  risk  of  having  to  engage  in  illegal  acts  to  generate \\nfunds.  \\n \\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \\n\\ninformation.  An \\n\\nindividual  who \\n\\nis \\n\\nAG ¶ 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \\n\\n \\n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and  \\n\\n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nThe  evidence  established  that  Applicant  accumulated  delinquent  debts  that  he \\nwas unable or unwilling to pay for an extended period. AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) apply in \\nthis case. \\n \\n \\napplicable:  \\n \\n\\nFour financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially \\n\\n(a)  the  behavior  happened  so  long  ago,  was  so  infrequent,  or  occurred \\nunder  such  circumstances  that  it  is  unlikely  to  recur  and  does  not  cast \\ndoubt  on  the  individual’s  current  reliability,  trustworthiness,  or  good \\njudgment; \\n \\n(b)  the  conditions  that  resulted  in  the  financial  problem  were  largely \\nbeyond  the  person’s  control  (e.g.,  loss  of  employment,  a  business \\ndownturn,  unexpected  medical  emergency,  or  a  death,  divorce  or \\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \\n\\n \\n5 \\n \\n \\n\\n\f",
       "(c)  the  person  has  received  or  is  receiving  counseling  for  the  problem \\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \\nunder control; and \\n \\n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \\notherwise resolve debts.  \\n \\nApplicant  incurred  delinquent  debts  because  he  continued  to  receive  disability \\nbenefits  after  his  income  exceeded  earning  limitations  and  because  he  failed  to  pay \\ntaxes  on  income  earned  in  2008  and  2009.  These  events  do  not  constitute \\ncircumstances beyond his control. AG ¶ 20(b) does not apply. \\n\\n \\nApplicant  has  resolved  the  state  tax  lien  in  SOR  ¶  1.a  and  the  disability \\noverpayment  in  SOR  ¶  1.c.  He  has  established  a  repayment  plan  to  resolve  the \\ndelinquent  federal  taxes  in  SOR  ¶  1.b.  He  has  been  consistently  making  payments \\nunder  that  plan  for  the  past  three  years.  The  record  established  that  his  financial \\nproblems  are  under  control  and  are  being  resolved.  He  has  not  incurred  any  recent \\ndelinquent debts. His financial problems are unlikely to recur and do not cast doubt on \\nhis current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(c), and 20(d) \\napply. \\n\\n \\n\\nWhole-Person Concept \\n\\nIn  the  adjudication  process,  an  administrative  judge  must  carefully  weigh  a \\nnumber  of  variables  known  as  the  whole-person  concept.  Available  information  about \\nthe applicant as well as the factors listed in AG ¶ 2(a) should be considered in reaching \\na  determination.11  In  this  case,  I  gave  due  consideration  to  the  information  about \\nApplicant in the record and concluded the favorable information, including the mitigating \\nevidence,  outweigh  the  security  concerns  at  issue.

All  allegations  relate  to  his  handling  of  confidential  data  in  December  2007 \\nand January 2008 and his participation in the follow-up investigation in 2009 and 2010. \\nApplicant was assured that “trusted downloads” provided by the Navy and Company L \\ndid not contain classified information, when two of them contained a mix of unclassified \\nand  classified  information.  Applicant  and  his  team  members  transferred  the  trusted \\ndownloads onto computers that were for unclassified use only. There was no evidence \\nthat any of the classified information was viewed by anyone not authorized to view it. \\nApplicant made some judgment errors in his reaction to the discovery of the classified \\ninformation. In March 2008, Applicant’s attorney offered to provide requested materials \\nto the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI); Applicant cooperated with the investigation; \\nand  Applicant’s  errors  in  judgment  are  not  recent.

(Tr. 179, 214; AE A) From 2008 to present, he has been \\nemployed by another defense contractor. (AE A) In January 2011, Applicant’s security \\nclearance was suspended. (GE 2; AE E)  \\n\\n \\nIn 1998, Applicant married. (Tr. 235) His spouse is a missile engineer, and she \\nhas a security clearance. (Tr. 216) He has two daughters who are 14 and 15. (Tr. 215) \\nHis  father  was  a  career  Navy  officer.  (Tr.  215)  His  two  older  brothers  served  in  the \\nNavy. (Tr. 215) His nephew was a Navy Seal, who served three tours in Afghanistan. \\n(Tr. 215) Applicant never served in the military. (Tr. 235) \\n\\n \\nCompany D funded Applicant’s college tuition, and in 1982, Applicant received a \\nbachelor  of  science  degree  in  mathematics.  (Tr.  178-179,  235;  AE  A)  After  1982, \\nApplicant worked on a variety of Navy contracts for Company D.  Sometimes he was \\nemployed at Company D, but detailed to work on Company L managed projects.

       "In 1999, Applicant was one of the architects of a program for a simulation test of \\npart of a weapons system developed by Company L by utilizing unclassified data. (Tr. \\n184;  GE  5;  GE  6)  From  1999  to  2007,  Applicant  was  instrumental  in  the  program \\ndevelopment. (Tr. 184-189). In November 2007, Applicant went to the Pentagon, and in \\nthe  presence  of  an  admiral,  was  shown  some  design  charts,  which  Applicant  had \\ndeveloped on behalf of Company D, and Company L had previously presented without \\nauthorization to the Navy. (Tr. 189) Applicant believed the information was improperly \\ntaken from Company D by Company L.  \\n\\n \\n\\nHandling Protected Information and Personal Conduct1  \\n\\n \\nApplicant was the leader of a team of technicians working on a Navy project. (Tr. \\n99; GE 5 at 1-2) On about 75 occasions over several years, Company L employees or \\nNavy personnel provided “trusted downloads” on flash drives or compact discs, which \\nwere supposed to be unclassified data or software that Applicant and his team could \\nuse  for  analysis.  (Tr.  94,  99-103;  GE  6  at  7)  Technicians  were  concerned  that  a  file \\nmarked  unclassified  might  actually  contain  classified  data.  (Tr.  87)  The  only  way \\nclassified information could be placed on unclassified computers was through an error \\nin  the  trusted-download  process,  or  a  deliberate  improper  transfer  of  classified \\ninformation. (Tr. 78) Applicant was not authorized to make a trusted download, and he \\ndenied knowingly transferring classified information to an unclassified computer. (Tr. 78)  \\nThere are eight or nine people that could have been responsible for entering data that \\nwas too close to the thresholds to be unclassified. (Tr. 214) \\n\\n \\nApplicant’s team’s project utilized a classified version and an unclassified version \\nof a computer program. The classified version used “a set of parameters, thresholds, \\nwhich [were] put together along with the executable part of the program” to generate a \\n“classified  result.”  (Tr.  100,  107)  The  classified  numbers  changed  as  the  project \\nadvanced.  (Tr.  122-123)  M  was  a  key  person  in  deciding  whether  data  should  be \\nclassified or not. (Tr. 128) The unclassified version of the program used numbers that \\nwere not representative of the real system to simulate interactions, which allowed use of \\nlaptops and communications in an unclassified environment and improved productivity. \\n(Tr. 100-101, 107) The non-representative numbers were used “to test the mechanics of \\nthe  program”  and  debug  problems  in  an  unclassified  environment.  (Tr.  108)  The \\nclassified numbers were not supposed to be used on unclassified computers. (Tr. 112) \\nM assumed the computer he was issued was from Company L and not from DOD. (Tr. \\n113) The unclassified versions could be used at home. (Tr. 100-102) Employees were \\nallowed to use company-issued computers for some personal use; however, extensive \\npersonal use was discouraged. (Tr. 124) At Company L, if a spillage was discovered, \\nCompany L’s facility security officer (FSO) was supposed to be notified. (Tr. 115) The \\nFSO was responsible for ensuring the file was deleted from computers. (Tr. 116) After \\ndeletion of the file, security used a cleaning program to scramble the computer memory. \\n\\n                                            \\n\\n1Unless stated otherwise, the source for the information in this section is a December 16, 2010, \\nletter from an FBI special agent written to the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) about \\nthe investigation of Applicant for unauthorized removal and retention of classified documents or material \\nin possible violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1924.

       "(Tr.  116)  Applicant  had  access  to  classified  versions  of  the  program  and  classified \\nprogram data. (Tr. 118) \\n\\n \\nEmployees  of  Companies  D  and  L  sought  to  maintain  separation  between  the \\nclassified  and  unclassified  versions.  (Tr.  101,  106-108)  In  2008,  the  security  people \\ninterviewed employees and borrowed computers with the programs on their computers \\nto check for a data spill. (Tr. 102) Security found files containing classified information \\non the computers of four to seven employees of Company L, including on M’s computer. \\n(Tr.  102-103,  118-121)  Security  performed  cleansing  operations  on  the  computers  to \\neliminate  the  files  with  classified  information.  (Tr.  102-103,  118-121)  Because  of  the \\nspillage,  the  whole  unclassified-simulation  program  was  terminated,  and  all  future \\nsimulation work was done on the classified side. (Tr. 119, 124) Team members worked \\non  different  areas  of  the  program.  (Tr.  104-105)  Their  work  would  be  subsequently \\nmerged,  which  could  cause  classified  data  to  be  unknowingly  transferred  from  one \\ncomputer to another, and no one would know the origin of the classified information.

(Tr.  221;  GE  5;  GE  6)  The \\ninformation was supposed to unclassified. Classified files from downloads were labeled \\nwith a C, and unclassified files from trusted downloads were labeled with a T for test. \\n(Tr. 192) In December 2007, B, a GS-13, who was the senior Navy employee on the \\nteam,  was  at  Applicant’s  residence,  when  they  were  doing  some computer  work.  (Tr. \\n92, 192) Applicant inserted a flash drive into B’s laptop computer and was surprised to \\nsee a file starting with a C, which meant the file could be classified. (Tr. 193, 217-218; \\nGE 5 at 2) Applicant had previously transferred the data from the flash drive to his DOD-\\nissued laptop computer without noticing the C-file. (Tr. 217) Applicant and B reviewed \\nthe content of the C-file and determined it was too “inchoate” and lacked a specification \\nto  be  classified.  (Tr.  193)  Nothing  inside  the  C-file  was  marked  classified,  and  the \\ncontent of the C-file never made it into a specification. (Tr. 193-194)  \\n\\n \\nIn  December  2007,  the  information  from  the  flash  drive  would  have  been \\nclassified; however, by 2015, it was clear that at most it was sensitive information. (Tr. \\n194, 220; GE 5 at 2) In 2007, the classification level for the data found on Applicant’s \\ncomputer  was  probably  confidential.  (GE  6 at  4)  B  and  Applicant  agreed  that  the file \\nshould be deleted, and B suggested that Applicant download a cleaning program to be \\nsure  it  was  deleted.  (Tr.  193;  GE  4  at  2;  GE  6  at  2)  They  deleted  the  file.  (Tr.  162) \\nApplicant obtained a cleaning program, which wipes out inactive files. (Tr. 195-196)2 It \\ndeletes files from the recycle bin. (Tr. 224) Applicant conceded it was bad judgment to \\ndelete  the  file  without  going  to  security.  (Tr.  195,  235)  Applicant  has  never  had  any \\nsecurity violations. (Tr. 195) Applicant did not disclose the possible transfer of classified \\ninformation  to  an  unclassified  system  until  August  19,  2010  when  he  met  with  an \\n                                            \\n\\n2Applicant is not the only team member with a clearing program on his DOD-issued computer. C \\nhas a cleaning or deletion program on his computer. (Tr. 80) C understood that if classified information \\nwere  found  on  an  unclassified  computer  the  safest  reaction  is  to  delete  the  classified  information  to \\nensure its protection from loss or compromise. (Tr. 80-81) The spillage should  also be reported  to the \\nFSO. (Tr. 85-86) \\n\\n\f",
       "Assistant U.S. Attorney (AUSA) and others for a proffer session. Applicant promised to \\nreport any spillage that occurs immediately to his company (FSO). (Tr. 214)   \\n\\n \\nOn January 18, 2008, two employees of a rival defense contractor (Company L) \\ntold investigators that Applicant may be responsible for the unauthorized removal and \\nretention of classified materials. (GE 4) \\n\\n \\nOn  January  28,  2008,  Company  D’s  FSO  called  Applicant  and  asked  him  to \\nprovide his two DOD-issued laptop computers to Company L. (Tr. 196, 229) One of the \\nrequested laptop computers was at Applicant’s home. (Tr. 197-199) The FSO did not \\nexplain why the computers were requested. (Tr. 199) Applicant said he would bring the \\ncomputers the next day, and the FSO did not insist or demand that Applicant provide \\nthe computer sooner. (GE 6 at 6) Applicant did not believe there had been classified \\ninformation on the laptop computers. (Tr. 200) Applicant said he deleted  some family \\npictures and other personal information that he did not want to release. (Tr. 139-140, \\n162-163,  169-170,  202,  227-229)  On  January  29,  2008,  Applicant  turned  in  the  two \\nlaptop computers. (GE 6 at 2) \\n\\n \\nIn  early  February  2008,  Applicant  went  to  another  state  where  there  was  a \\ncomputer  with  the  same  program.  Two  subject  matter  experts  (SMEs),  who  were \\nassociated with Applicant’s team, reviewed the “unclassified data” on the hard drive and \\ndetermined  that  there was  probably  classified  data  on  the  computer.  (Tr.  76-77,  205, \\n213;  GE  6  at  2-3)  Most  of  the  information  was  unclassified;  however,  the  classified \\ninformation  was  one  table  of  numbers  or  parameters,  and  none  of  the  SMEs  were \\naware  of  how  the  classified  table  had  migrated  from  the  classified  system  to  the \\nunclassified  system.  (Tr.  77,  88,  90,  213,  232-233)  In  February  2008,  Applicant \\ncontacted Company D’s FSO and advised her of the possibility of confidential data on \\nteam computers. The computers were collected to detect any spillage. (Tr. 205-206; GE \\n6 at 4) One of the SMEs also contacted his FSO about the possible spillage. (Tr. 206)   \\n\\n \\nApplicant  consulted  a  Navy  captain,  who  advised  Applicant  to  seek  the \\nassistance of counsel, and in February 2008, he hired a counsel with significant national \\nsecurity  experience.  (Tr.  203;  GE  5  at  2;  GE  6  at  4;  AE  M)  On  March  4,  2008, \\nApplicant’s  counsel  disclosed  to  the  FBI  that  Applicant  deleted  the  Company  D \\nproprietary files because Company L had requested the computers. (AE B at 2-3)  \\n\\n \\nAfter receipt of the first two computers, the Naval Criminal Investigative Service \\n(NCIS)  and  FBI  wanted  to  check  a  laptop  computer  and  a  desk  top  computer  in \\nApplicant’s  possession  for  spillage.  NCIS  requested  the  two  computers  in  February \\n2008. (Tr. 141; AE B) Applicant had saved tax returns and other personal information on \\nthe  desktop  computer.  The  desk  top  computer  was  obsolete  and  lacked  sufficient \\ncomputer  power  to  run  simulations,  and  Applicant  believed  it  had  no  risk  of  having \\nclassified data on it. (Tr. 210) Applicant’s attorney wanted to find out whether the two \\ncomputers were owned by Applicant, Company D, or DOD before providing them to the \\nFBI  or  NCIS.  (Tr.  141)  With  the  assistance  of  Company  D,  Applicant’s  attorney \\ndetermined  the  two  computers  were  probably  owned  by  DOD.  On  March  4,  2008, \\nApplicant’s  attorney  wrote  the  FBI  volunteering  to  have  Applicant  provide  the  two \\n\\n \\n5 \\n                                         \\n \\n\\n\f",

(Tr. 143-147, 164-165, 226; AE B; AE H) The FBI did not allege \\nthat  there  were  deletions  from  the  two  computers  Applicant  provided  in  March  2008; \\nhowever, Applicant said the Company D proprietary information that he did not want to \\nrelease to Company L was on the second set of computers provided to NCIS and the \\nFBI. (Tr. 228-230) Applicant deleted the Company D proprietary information. (Tr. 228-\\n232) Applicant’s attorney disclosed to the FBI that she had retained a copy of the hard \\ndrive of the desktop computer in her office safe. (Tr. 144; AE B) The FBI never asked \\nfor the copy of the hard drive. (Tr. 144-145) There is no evidence that the FBI found any \\nclassified information on the two computers provided on March 4, 2008. (Tr. 172)       \\n\\n \\nInvestigators checked some of the computers used in the project; however, they \\ndid  not  check  all  of the  other  computers  used  on the project  that  logically  might  also \\nhave spillage. (Tr. 79, 81, 88-89) C assumed that Company L was out to get Applicant \\nbecause  of  how  he  was  targeted  by  the  investigation.  (Tr.  82-83)  The  FBI  did  not \\ninterview C. (Tr. 80) \\n\\n \\nOn August 19, 2010, Applicant and his counsel met with an AUSA and others for \\na proffer session. (Tr. 149) Applicant advised the FBI that Applicant had compact discs \\nthat he  received from  Company  L  with  trusted  downloads for  testing  simulations.  (Tr. \\n156-159,  210,  212)  The  discs  were  marked  unclassified.  (Tr.  210)  Applicant  also \\ndisclosed  he  had  the  flash  drive  that  contained  the  C-file  that  he  downloaded  on  his \\ncomputer in December 2007. (Tr. 222) He had previously deleted the C-file off of the \\nflash drive. (Tr. 224) On August 23, 2010, Applicant provided the requested compact \\ndiscs and flash drive to the NCIS. (Tr. 159, 170, 222; AE H)  \\n\\n \\nAt  the  August  19,  2010  proffer,  AUSA,  an  FBI  special  agent,  and  two  NCIS \\nspecial agents asked Applicant numerous questions about the computers, project, and \\nclassified  data.  (Tr.  150;  AE  C)  The  forensic  examination  determined  that  classified \\nmaterials had been stored on one of the laptop computers. FBI SMEs, who were not \\nrelated to Applicant’s team, reviewed the “classified values” and concluded 11 values \\nwere not sufficiently scrambled to render them unclassified. (Tr. 213; GE 3; GE 5 at 3; \\nAE P) The classification level was deemed to be confidential. (AE L; AE P) Applicant \\nbelieved the FBI SMEs erred in the manner that some of the numbers were “reverse \\nengineered”  and  classified  as  confidential  or  secret.  (GE  6  at  5)  The  FBI  had  been \\nrelying  on  erroneous  information  from  SMEs,  and  the  FBI  SMEs  had  mistakenly \\nconfused some of the unclassified testing numbers with classified data. (Tr. 151, 154, \\n211; GE 3) Applicant agreed with the FBI that one table contained classified numbers. \\n(Tr.  151-154;  GE  5  at  2-3)  Applicant  conceded  his  unclassified  computer  should  not \\nhave  been  used  for  classified  information  because  it  did  not  contain  the  security \\nmeasures required for storage of classified material. (Tr. 155-156)  \\n\\n \\nThe AUSA appeared to accept that Applicant was involved in an inadvertent spill \\nof  classified  numbers  as  opposed  to  a  deliberate  attempt  to  compromise  classified \\ninformation. (Tr. 152) On December 16, 2010, an FBI special agent wrote the Defense \\nIndustrial  Security  Clearance  Office  (DISCO)  about  the  investigation  of  Applicant  for \\nunauthorized  removal  and  retention  of  classified  documents  or  material  in  possible \\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 1924. (GE 3) The FBI letter advised that no charges would be \\n\\n \\n6 \\n                                         \\n \\n\\n\f",

(Tr. 153) \\n\\n \\nFrom January 2008 to August 2010, the FBI and NCIS did not ask Applicant for \\nany evidence. (GE 6 at 7) On March 4, 2008, Applicant’s attorney  wrote the FBI and \\noffered  to  cooperate  with  the  FBI  investigation.

(Tr.  66-67)  He  has  complete  confidence  in  Applicant’s  ability  to \\nprotect classified information and recommends reinstatement of his access to classified \\ninformation.

As  Commander  in  Chief,  the  President  has  the \\nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \\nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. \\nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \\napplicant’s  eligibility  for  access  to  classified  information  “only  upon  a  finding  that  it  is \\nclearly  consistent  with  the  national  interest  to  do  so.”  Exec.  Or.  10865,  Safeguarding \\nClassified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  \\n \\n\\nEligibility  for  a  security  clearance  is  predicated  upon  the  applicant  meeting  the \\ncriteria  contained  in  the  revised  adjudicative  guidelines.  These  guidelines  are  not \\ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \\nguidelines  are  applied  in  conjunction  with  an  evaluation  of  the  whole  person.  An \\nadministrative \\nimpartial,  and \\ncommonsense  decision.  An  administrative  judge  must  consider  all  available,  reliable \\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \\n\\njudge’s  overarching  adjudicative  goal \\n\\n  \\nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \\naccess  to  classified  information.  This  relationship  transcends  normal  duty  hours  and \\nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \\npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \\nabout  potential,  rather  than  actual,  risk  of  compromise  of  classified  information. \\nClearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \\n\\nis  a \\n\\nfair, \\n\\n \\n8 \\n                                         \\n \\n\\n\f",
       "a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. \\nThis decision is not based, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination \\nabout applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. Thus, any decision to deny a security \\nclearance  is  merely  an  indication  the  applicant  has  not  met  the  strict  guidelines  the \\nPresident and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  \\n\\n \\n \\nInitially,  the  Government  must  establish,  by  substantial  evidence,  conditions  in \\nthe  personal  or  professional  history  of  the  applicant  that  may  disqualify  the  applicant \\nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \\nof  establishing  controverted  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  See  Egan,  484  U.S.  at  531. \\n“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. \\nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \\npresume  a  nexus  or  rational  connection  between  proven  conduct  under  any  of  the \\ncriteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \\nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \\n \\n\\nOnce  the  Government  establishes  a  disqualifying  condition  by  substantial \\nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \\nfacts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \\nis  clearly  consistent  with  the  national  interest  to  grant  or  continue  his  security \\nclearance.”  ISCR  Case  No.  01-20700  at  3  (App.  Bd.  Dec.  19,  2002).  The  burden  of \\ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. \\n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd.

       "Further analysis concerning applicability of mitigating conditions is required. The \\nAppeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving the applicability \\nof mitigating conditions as follows:  \\n\\n \\nOnce  a  concern  arises  regarding  an  Applicant’s  security  clearance \\neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \\nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \\nCir.  1990),  cert.  denied,  499  U.S.  905  (1991).  After  the  Government \\npresents  evidence  raising  security  concerns,  the  burden  shifts  to  the \\napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The \\nstandard  applicable  in  security  clearance  decisions  is  that  articulated  in \\nEgan,  supra.  “Any  doubt  concerning  personnel  being  considered  for \\naccess  to  classified  information  will  be  resolved  in  favor  of  the  national \\nsecurity.” Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b).  \\n \\n\\nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  \\n\\n \\nThree mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 17 are potentially applicable:  \\n \\n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \\nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \\nunlikely  to  recur  and  does  not  cast  doubt  on  the  individual's  reliability, \\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \\n \\n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \\nto  change  the  behavior  or  taken  other  positive  steps  to  alleviate  the \\nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \\nor  other  inappropriate  behavior,  and  such  behavior  is  unlikely  to  recur;  \\nand \\n \\n(e)  the  individual  has  taken  positive  steps  to  reduce  or  eliminate \\nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \\n \\nAG ¶ 16(e) is mitigated by AG ¶ 17(e) because Applicant has fully disclosed his \\nrule violations. Law enforcement, security officials, and his witnesses are well aware of \\nhis  security-related  conduct,  and he  is not  vulnerable  to  exploitation, manipulation,  or \\nduress because of his security-related conduct. \\n\\n \\nAG ¶¶ 17(c) and 17(d) apply. The only evidence of Applicant’s December 2007 \\nsecurity breach was Applicant’s self-report; however, his self-report was not timely, as it \\nappears  it  was  disclosed  at  his  August  19,  2010  AUSA  proffer.  However,  Applicant’s \\nfailure to report the December 2007 security breach is not recent; the security breach \\nwas  inadvertent;  “it  happened  under  such  unique  circumstances  that  it  is  unlikely  to \\nrecur;”  and  it  “does  not  cast  doubt  on  Applicant’s  reliability,  trustworthiness,  or  good \\njudgment.”  He  admitted  that  he  showed  poor  judgment  in  December  2007  when  he \\ndiscovered that he had downloaded possible classified information onto B’s computer \\nand his own computer, and he failed to report this security breach to his FSO (SOR ¶ \\n\\n \\n11 \\n                                         \\n \\n\\n\f",

Security  needed  to  assess  the  scope  of  the  breach  of  security  or  spillage,  and \\nsecurity was unable to check other computers and determine who was responsible for \\nthe “trusted download” that caused the security breach.  \\n\\n \\nApplicant  understands  the  importance  of  informing  security  of  any  security \\nbreach or possible security breach, and I am confident he will timely disclosed required \\ninformation. Personal conduct concerns are mitigated. Even if security concerns are not \\nmitigated under Guideline E, they are mitigated under the whole-person concept, infra. \\n \\nHandling Protected Information  \\n \\n  \\nAG  ¶  33  articulates  the  security  concern  relating  to  handling  protected \\ninformation  as  follows,  “Deliberate  or  negligent  failure  to  comply  with  rules  and \\nregulations for protecting classified or other sensitive information raises doubt about an \\nindividual’s trustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or willingness and ability to safeguard \\nsuch information, and is a serious security concern.” \\n\\n \\nAG  ¶  34  provides  three  disqualifying  conditions  that  could  raise  a  security \\n\\n  \\nconcern and may be disqualifying in this case:  \\n \\n\\n(b) collecting or storing classified or other protected information at home or \\nin any other unauthorized location; \\n \\n(c) loading, drafting, editing, modifying, storing, transmitting, or otherwise \\nhandling classified reports, data, or other information on any unapproved \\nequipment including but not limited to any typewriter, word processor, or \\ncomputer  hardware,  software,  drive,  system,  gameboard,  handheld, \\n\"palm\" or pocket device or other adjunct equipment; and \\n \\n(g) any failure to comply with rules for the protection of classified or other \\nsensitive information. \\n\\n \\n\\nAG ¶¶ 34(b), 34(c), and 34(g) apply. These three disqualifying conditions do not \\ninclude  a  requirement  that  Applicant  knew  he  was  downloading  classified  information \\nonto  an  unclassified  system,  and  they  do  not  require  that  he  be  aware  that  his \\nunclassified computer systems contain classified information.  \\n\\n \\nSOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.c discussed previously are cross-alleged under SOR ¶¶ 2.a \\nand  2.c.  In  December  2007,  Applicant  discovered  that  he  had  downloaded  possible \\nclassified  information  onto  B’s  computer  and  his  own  computer.  The  two  computers \\nwere not authorized for storage of classified information.   \\n\\n \\nThe hard drive of one of Applicant’s DOD-issued laptop computers was restricted \\nto unclassified information use, and a forensic evaluation and SME review found that his \\nlaptop computer contained some data classified at the confidential level. Applicant was \\nunaware  this  computer  contained  classified  information.  He  is  not  responsible  for \\n\\n \\n12 \\n                                         \\n \\n\\n\f",
       "“trusted  downloads,”  and  he  inadvertently  downloaded  classified  information  from  a \\ntrusted download onto his hard drive.  \\n\\n \\nThree mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 35 are potentially applicable:  \\n\\n \\n\\n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior, or it has happened so \\ninfrequently  or  under  such  unusual  circumstances,  that  it  is  unlikely  to \\nrecur  and  does  not  cast  doubt  on  the  individual's  current  reliability, \\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \\n \\n(b) the individual responded favorably to counseling or remedial security \\ntraining and now demonstrates a positive attitude toward the discharge of \\nsecurity responsibilities; and \\n \\n(c) the security violations were due to improper or inadequate training. \\n  \\nAG ¶¶ 35(a) through 35(c) apply. As indicated in the previous section, AG ¶ 35(a) \\nis  established.  The  particular  simulation  program  involving  inadvertent  transfers  of \\nclassified data to unclassified systems was changed to a completely classified system. \\nSuch  erroneous  “trusted  downloads”  will  not  recur.  Applicant  understands  how \\nimportant it is to avoid future transfers of classified information to unclassified computer \\nsystems.  He  has  been  counseled  and  understands  that  when  a  security  violation  is \\ndiscovered, it should be timely reported to his FSO. He has a positive attitude towards \\nconscientiously complying with security requirements.  \\n\\n \\nApplicant’s  actions  since  March  2008  show  sufficient  effort,  good  judgment, \\n  \\ntrustworthiness,  and  reliability  to  warrant  mitigation  of  handling  protected  information \\nsecurity  concerns.  Even  if  handling  protected  information  concerns  are  not  mitigated \\nunder Guideline K, they are mitigated under the whole-person concept, infra.    \\n\\n \\n\\nWhole-Person Concept \\n\\n \\n Under  the  whole-person  concept,  the  administrative  judge  must  evaluate  an \\nApplicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s \\nconduct  and all  the  circumstances.

       "Under  AG  ¶  2(c),  the  ultimate  determination  of  whether  to  grant  eligibility  for  a \\nsecurity  clearance  must  be  an  overall  commonsense  judgment  based  upon  careful \\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \\ncomments under Guidelines E and K in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors \\nin AG ¶ 2(a)  were addressed under Guidelines  E and K, but some warrant additional \\ncomment. \\n\\n  \\nApplicant is a 56-year-old software engineer employed by Company D from 1980 \\nto 2007. From 2008 to present, he has been employed by another defense contractor. \\nHis spouse is a security clearance holder; his father was a career Navy officer; his two \\nolder brothers served in the Navy; and his nephew was a Navy Seal, who served three \\ntours  in  Afghanistan.  In  1982,  Applicant  received  a  bachelor  of  science  degree  in \\nmathematics.  During  Desert  Shield,  Applicant  was  deployed  for  six  months  to  the \\nPersian Gulf aboard a U.S. Navy vessel.   \\n\\n \\nA Navy captain, who has known Applicant since the late 1990s; a high-level DOD \\nemployee, who has oversight authority over about 9,000 of DOD employees and a $300 \\nmillion budget and who has known Applicant since the 1990s; a program director on a \\nproject,  who  has  known  Applicant  since  2003;  two  contractors,  who  worked  with \\nApplicant  on  the  project  at  issue;  and  Applicant’s  attorney  described  Applicant  in \\nlaudatory  terms.  Applicant  is  an  “incredibly  gifted,”  exceptionally  creative,  and \\n“incredibly skilled” technician and engineer. He is diligent, intelligent, professional, open, \\ncandid, honest, and conscientious about the protection of classified information. Most of \\nhis  character  witnesses  were  aware  of  the  SOR  allegations,  had  read  Applicant’s \\nstatements in 2011 and 2013, and recommended reinstatement of Applicant’s security \\nclearance.  \\n\\n \\nApplicant’s  SOR  allegations  relate  to  his  handling  of  confidential  information  in \\nDecember  2007  and  January  2008  and  participation  in  the  follow-up  investigation  in \\n2009  and  2010.  Company  L  or  Navy  employees  provided  “trusted  downloads”  to \\nApplicant and his team. The trusted downloads were not supposed to contain classified \\ndata or software; however, there was some classified data mixed in with the unclassified \\ndata. Applicant and other members of his team unknowingly downloaded the classified \\nand  unclassified  information  onto  computers  allocated  to  unclassified  information. \\nApplicant  did  not  compromise  classified  information  as  there  is  no  evidence  the \\nunclassified  computers  were  used  by  anyone  not  authorized  to  review  the  classified \\ninformation. In December 2007, Applicant discovered possible classified information on \\nhis unclassified computer and on B’s computer. B and Applicant agreed that they should \\ndelete  it,  and  they  did  so.  This  error  was  aggravated  when  Applicant  and  B  failed  to \\ndisclose the discovery of the probable classified information on the flash drive and their \\ncomputers  to  their  FSOs.  Applicant  did  not  receive  adequate  training  or  supervision \\nfrom  B,  a  GS-13  Navy  employee  on  this  occasion.  There  was  no  evidence  that \\nApplicant was told prior to December 2007 of the protocol after discovery of possible \\nclassified information on an unclassified computer.  \\n\\n \\nAfter  two  of  Applicant’s  assigned  DOD-issued  computers  were  requested,  he \\ndeleted Company D proprietary information and personal information before providing \\n\\n \\n14 \\n                                         \\n \\n\\n\f",
       "one  computer  to  Company  D  and  one  computer to  NCIS. These deletions  raised  the \\npossibility  that  he  was  intentionally  obstructing  the  investigation  because  forensic \\nexamination revealed there were deletions, but could not determine the content of the \\ndeletions.  Applicant  provided  the  only  evidence  of  the  content  of  the  deletions.  In \\nFebruary  2008,  after  Applicant  made  the  deletions,  he  hired  an  experienced  national \\nsecurity attorney who advised him to cooperate with the investigation. After March 2008, \\nApplicant  cooperated  with  the  investigation,  and  his  attorney  notified  the  FBI  that  he \\nwould assist the investigation. His errors in judgment were made from December 2007 \\nthrough February 2008 and are not recent.   \\n\\n \\nApplicant’s hearing statement was credible. He understands what he needs to do \\nto maintain his eligibility for access to classified information. He has avoided any hint of \\nviolation  of  his  employer’s  rules  or  security  rules  after  March  2008.  He  expressed \\nsincere remorse for his infractions of security rules and errors in judgment in December \\n2007  and  January  2008,  and  he  emphasized  his  determination  to  conscientiously \\ncomply  with  all  security  rules  and  requirements.  I  am  confident  he  will  continue  to \\nconscientiously exercise his security responsibilities in the future. \\n\\n    \\nI  have  carefully  applied  the  law,  as  set  forth  in  Egan,  Exec.  Or.  10865,  the \\nDirective,  and  the  AGs,  to  the  facts  and  circumstances  in  the  context  of  the  whole \\nperson.

Applicant  did  not  respond  to  the  FORM.  I  was \\nassigned the case on December 1, 2015. Based on a thorough review of the case file, I \\nfind that Applicant failed to carry his burden in mitigating security concerns arising under \\nboth Guideline B and Guideline E.  \\n\\n     Findings of Fact \\n\\n \\nApplicant  is  a  71-year-old  man  who  is  presently  not  working  while  his  security \\nclearance is updated. He has earned a high school diploma. He was divorced in 1998 \\n                                                           \\n1 The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \\nSecurity  Clearance  Review  Program  (January  2,  1992),  as  amended  (Directive);  and  the  adjudicative \\nguidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on September 1, 2006. \\n\\n1 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\f",
       "and is now estranged from a subsequent spouse. Facts about this estranged female are \\nunclear,  although  it  appears  she  is  from  Russia,  where  she  currently  resides  with  or \\nnear  family.  He  provided  incomplete  information  on  his  security  clearance  application \\n(SCA)  about  his  family  and  children.  Other  discrepancies  appear  throughout  his \\ninvestigatory record. Applicant presently lives in another country with a female foreign \\nnational  in  order  to  reduce  the  costs  he  would  otherwise  expend  living  in  the  United \\nStates while awaiting a return to work.  \\n \\n \\nAt issue in the SOR are the following facts: Applicant has a wife who is a citizen \\nand resident of Russia.2 They are estranged, but Applicant has no plans to divorce his \\nforeign  wife  because  he  no  longer  believes  in  divorce.  He  has  a  daughter  who  is  a \\ncitizen  of  the  United  States  and  is  currently  a  resident  of  Russia,  where  she  is  a \\nuniversity student. He also has parents-in-law who are citizens and residents of Russia. \\nApplicant met them in about July 1998 on a visit to their home. He again saw them on a \\nsubsequent  trip  to  Russia  with  his  wife.  He  has  had  no  other  contact  with  them  and \\ndoes not know how often his estranged wife currently has with her parents now that all \\nthree  are  in  Russia.  His  father-in-law  and  mother-in-law  are  a  teacher  and  a \\ngynecologist,  respectively.  Applicant  assumed  they  were  Communists  because  the \\nCommunists were in power when he met them. As of 2015, Russia is one of the two \\nleading state intelligence threats to United States interests, based on their capabilities, \\nintent,  and  broad  operational  scopes.3  Applicant  admits  the  Guideline  B  SOR \\nallegations, but did not address them in any manner in his SOR Response.     \\n \\n \\nIn completing SCAs in both August 3, 2009, and March 23, 2013, Applicant failed \\nto  list  multiple  names  he  has  used,  places  of  former  residence,  periods  of \\nunemployment, relatives, and foreign contacts. He told an investigator in 2010 that he \\nhad no problems while working with a particular employer, but later conceded he was \\ninvolved in a harassment suit while working there. Despite a 2010 claim to the contrary, \\nhe failed in 2007 to file an appropriate contact with foreign nationals report regarding the \\nforeign woman with whom he currently cohabitates. Applicant admits these allegations.  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\nPolicies \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nWhen  evaluating  an  applicant’s  suitability \\n\\n \\n \\nthe \\nadministrative  judge  must  consider  the  adjudicative  guidelines.  In  addition  to  brief \\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \\ndisqualifying  conditions  and  mitigating  conditions,  which  are  used  in  evaluating  an \\napplicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. \\n \\n\\nfor  a  security  clearance, \\n\\nThese  guidelines  are  not  inflexible  rules  of  law.  Instead,  recognizing  the \\ncomplexities  of  human  behavior,  these  guidelines  are  applied  in  conjunction  with  the \\n                                                           \\n2  In  some  records  within  the  FORM,  Applicant  indicated  that  his  estranged  wife  became  a  naturalized \\ncitizen in 2007 or 2008 and now resides in the United States, but the discrepancies are never resolved. \\n(See FORM, Item 6) \\n \\n3 FORM, Item 9, at 3. \\n\\n2 \\n\\n\f",
       "factors  listed  in  the  adjudicative  process.  The  administrative  judge’s  overarching \\nadjudicative  goal  is  a  fair,  impartial,  and  commonsense  decision.  According  to  AG  ¶ \\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \\nthe  “whole-person  concept.”  The  administrative  judge  must  consider  all  available, \\nreliable information about the person in making a decision. \\n\\n \\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) \\nrequires  that  “[a]ny  doubt  concerning  personnel  being  considered  for  access  to \\nclassified  information  will  be  resolved  in  favor  of  national  security.”  In  reaching  this \\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \\non the evidence contained in the record.  \\n\\n \\nUnder Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \\ncontroverted  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  Under  Directive  ¶  E3.1.15,  an  “applicant  is \\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \\nmitigate  facts  admitted  by  applicant  or  proven  by  Department  Counsel  and  has  the \\nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.”  \\n\\nthe  Government  predicated  upon \\n\\n \\nA  person  who  seeks  access  to  classified  information  enters  into  a  fiduciary \\nrelationship  with \\ntrust  and  confidence.  This \\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \\nGovernment  reposes  a  high  degree  of  trust  and  confidence  in  individuals  to  whom  it \\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \\nthe  possible  risk  the  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  safeguard \\nclassified information. Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall \\nbe “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \\nloyalty of the applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b).  \\n\\nThe security concern relating to the Guideline B is set out in AG ¶ 6: \\n\\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \\nany  foreign  interest.  Adjudication  under  this  Guideline  can  and  should \\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \\nfinancial \\nto,  such \\nconsiderations  as  whether  the  foreign  country  is  known  to  target  United \\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \\nrisk of terrorism. \\n\\nincluding,  but  not \\n\\nlocated, \\n\\ninterest \\n\\nlimited \\n\\nis \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n3 \\n\\nAnalysis \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\f",
       "Applicant remains married to the female of Russian origin at issue. Therefore, it \\ncan be assumed he maintains some level of affection for this woman, the mother of his \\nchild. It can also be assumed he maintains a bond or ties of affection for their child, who \\nis  now  studying  at  a  Russian  college.  As  for  his  in-laws,  while  their  contact  with \\nApplicant is negligible, it can be assumed his estranged partner has ties of affection with \\nher own parents. Those ties are routinely attributed to the spouse (Applicant) in these \\ncases. Given these facts, disqualifying conditions AG ¶¶ 7(a) and (b) apply:  \\n \\n\\nto  protect  sensitive \\n\\nAG ¶ 7(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \\nassociate,  friend,  or  other  person  who  is  a  citizen  of  or  resident  in  a \\nforeign  country  if  that  contact  creates  a  heightened  risk  of  foreign \\nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \\n \\nAG ¶ 7(b) connection to a foreign person, group, government, or country \\nthat  create  a  potential  conflict  of  interest  between  the  individual’s \\nobligation \\nthe \\nindividual’s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \\nthat information. \\n \\nIn  finding  disqualifying  conditions  applicable,  I  specifically  note  that  AG  ¶  7(a) \\nrequires substantial evidence of a heightened risk. The heightened risk required to raise \\na  disqualifying  condition  is  a  relatively  low  standard.  Heightened  risk  denotes  a  risk \\ngreater than the normal risk inherent in having a family member living under a foreign \\ngovernment or substantial assets in a foreign nation. Russia is one of the two leading \\nstate intelligence threats to United States interests. In addition, foreign family ties can \\npose a security risk even without a connection to a foreign government. This is because \\nan applicant may be subject to coercion or undue influence when a third party pressures \\nor  threatens  an  applicant’s family  members.  Under  these facts,  while  unlikely,  a  third \\nparty  coercion  concern  potentially  exists  in  Russia.  Therefore,  there  is  sufficient \\nevidence to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \\n\\ninformation  or \\n\\ntechnology  and \\n\\n  \\nAG ¶ 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \\n\\nof the mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 8, and find the following are relevant: \\n \\n\\nAG ¶ 8(a) the nature of the relationship with foreign persons, the country in \\nwhich  these  persons  are  located,  or  the  positions  or  activities  of  those \\npersons  in  that  country  are  such  that  it  is  unlikely  the  individual  will  be \\nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \\nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.; \\nand \\n\\n \\n\\nAG  ¶  8(b)  there  is  no  conflict  of  interest,  either  because  the  individual’s \\nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or \\ncountry  is  so  minimal,  or  the  individual  has  such  deep  and  longstanding \\nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to \\nresolve any conflict of interests in favor of the U.S. interests.  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n4 \\n\\n\f",
       "The mere possession of close family ties to persons in a foreign country is not, \\nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in \\na foreign country and an applicant has frequent, non-casual contacts with that relative, \\nthis  factor  alone  is  sufficient  to  create  the  potential  for  foreign  influence  and  could \\npotentially result in the compromise of classified information.  \\n\\n \\nHere,  Applicant  provided  scant  information about  his estranged  wife,  daughter, \\nand  in-laws.  Indeed,  information  about  his  in-laws  is  more  abundant  than  information \\nabout his child and her mother. While his personal ties to his in-laws may be weak, their \\nimpact on Applicant cannot be discerned without more information about his wife and \\nchild. Under these limited facts, no mitigating conditions weigh in Applicant’s favor. \\n\\nThe  security  concern  for  personal  conduct  is  set  out  in  AG  ¶  15,  where  the \\nsignificance of conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \\nunwillingness  to  comply  with  rules  and  regulations  is  defined  ([p]ersonal  conduct  can \\nraise  questions  about  an  individual’s  reliability,  trustworthiness  and  ability  to  protect \\nclassified  information).  Of  special  interest  is  any  failure to  provide  truthful and  candid \\nanswers during the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the \\nsecurity clearance process.  \\n\\n \\nIn completing his 2009 and 2013 SCAs, Applicant’s answers in many areas were \\neither deficient or in conflict. His answers in a 2010 interview were either intentionally or \\nnegligently incomplete  with regard to past  workplace problems and the reporting of a \\nforeign  cohabitant  to  his  former  employer.  If  these  inaccuracies  were  intentionally \\nincorrect, such facts could give rise to:  \\n\\n \\nAG  ¶  16(a)  deliberate  omission,  concealment,  or  falsification  of  relevant \\nfacts \\nfrom  any  personnel  security  questionnaire,  personal  history \\nstatement,  or  similar  form  used  to  conduct  investigations,  determine \\nemployment  qualifications,  award  benefits  or  status,  determine  security \\nclearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities, \\nand  \\n \\nAG  ¶  16(b)  deliberately  providing \\ninformation \\nconcerning  relevant  facts  to  an  employer,  investigator,  security  official, \\ncompetent medical authority, or other official government representative. \\n \\nApplicant admitted all three allegations raised under Guideline E and provided no \\nexplanations or commentary. While his admission to the SCA discrepancies could be \\ndiscounted and his discrepancies found to be the product of negligence, this guideline \\ncould  be  found  in  his  favor.  In  admitting  allegations  that  he  knowingly  withheld \\ninformation and denied having had problems while employed at a place where he was \\ninvolved in a harassment suit, however, the facts tend to indicate that these answers – \\nwithout  more  –  were  intentionally  false  or  misleading.

He received a commission \\nas an officer in Russia’s reserve military forces and worked for a time for the Russian \\nDefense Ministry. He immigrated to the United States in 1997 and married his wife, who \\nis also originally from Russia, in 2002. They have one child, who was born in the United \\nStates.  \\n \\n\\nApplicant  became  a  U.S.  citizen  in  2005.  Applicant,  his  wife,  and  his  child  all \\nhave  dual  U.S.-Russian  citizenships.

However, based on the present record, I cannot find that Applicant’s failure to raise an objection to \\nEx. 5 amounts to an agreement as to the exhibits accuracy, reliability, and relevancy. Contrast with, ISCR \\nCase No. 14-03112 (App. Bd.

Individual  applicants  are  eligible  for  access  to \\nclassified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent  with  the  national \\ninterest” to authorize such access. E.O. 10865 § 2. \\n\\n \\nWhen  evaluating  an  applicant’s  eligibility \\n\\nfor  a  security  clearance,  an \\nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \\nintroductory  explanations,  the  guidelines  list  potentially  disqualifying  and  mitigating \\nconditions.  The  guidelines  are  not  inflexible  rules  of  law.  Instead,  recognizing  the \\ncomplexities  of  human  behavior,  an  administrative  judge  applies  the  guidelines  in  a  \\ncommonsense manner, considering all available and reliable information, in arriving at a \\nfair and impartial decision.  \\n\\n \\nDepartment  Counsel  must  present  evidence  to  establish  controverted  facts \\nalleged  in  the  SOR.  Directive  ¶  E3.1.14.  Applicants  are  responsible  for  presenting \\n“witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by \\nthe applicant or proven . . . and has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a \\nfavorable clearance decision.” Directive ¶ E3.1.15.  \\n\\n \\nAdministrative Judges are responsible for ensuring that due process proceedings \\nare conducted “in a fair, timely and orderly manner.” Directive ¶ E3.1.10.

ISCR Case \\nNo. 12-01266 at 3 (App. Bd.

       "“security  clearance  determinations  should  err,  if  they  must,  on  the  side  of  denials.” \\nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \\n\\nthe  Government  predicated  upon \\n\\n \\nA  person  who  seeks  access  to  classified  information  enters  into  a  fiduciary \\n \\nrelationship  with \\ntrust  and  confidence.  This \\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of \\ntrust  and  confidence  in  individuals  to  whom  it  grants  access  to  classified  information. \\nDecisions  include,  by  necessity,  consideration  of  the  possible  risk  an  applicant  may \\ndeliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  safeguard  classified  information.  Such  decisions \\nentail  a  certain  degree  of  legally  permissible  extrapolation  of  potential,  rather  than \\nactual, risk of compromise of classified information. \\n \\n\\nClearance  decisions  must  be  made  “in  terms  of  the  national  interest  and  shall \\nin  no  sense  be  a  determination  as  to  the  loyalty  of  the  applicant  concerned.”  E.O. \\n10865 § 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance amounts to a finding that an \\napplicant,  at  the  time  the  decision  was  rendered,  did  not  meet  the  strict  guidelines \\nestablished for determining eligibility for access to classified information. \\n\\n \\n\\nAnalysis \\n\\n \\n\\nGuideline C, Foreign Preference  \\n \\n \\nUnder  AG  ¶  9,  the  foreign  preference  security  concern  arises  “[w]hen  an \\nindividual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the \\nUnited States.” Applicant actively exercised his foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. \\ncitizen,  including  voting  in  Russian  elections  and  renewing,  using,  and  maintaining  a \\nRussian passport. This record evidence raises the foreign preference security concern \\nand  establishes  the  disqualifying  condition  at  AG  ¶  10(a).10  The  foreign  preference \\nguideline also sets forth a number of potential mitigation conditions. I have considered \\nall the mitigating conditions and none apply. Notably, Applicant currently has a foreign \\npassport and is unwilling to relinquish or surrender it. A current or prospective clearance \\nholder  is  ineligible  for  a  security  clearance  unless  s/he  surrenders  it  to  the  cognizant \\nsecurity authority (CSA), invalidates the foreign passport, or receives approval from the \\nCSA for his/her continued possession and use of the foreign passport. See AG ¶¶ 11(d) \\nand  11(e).  Applicant  did  not  supply  any  information  that  any  of  the  preceding \\ncircumstances apply. Accordingly, foreign preference security concerns remain.  \\n \\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \\n \\n\\nThe foreign influence security concern is explained at AG ¶ 6:  \\n \\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \\n\\n                                                           \\n10 Exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen . . .

AG ¶ 2(b). \\n \\n \\nI  have  considered  all  the foreign  influence mitigating  conditions and,  based  on \\nthe  record  evidence,  none  apply.  Even  if  I  assume  for  the  sake  of  argument  that \\nApplicant’s property and non-familial connections in Russia are not significant enough to \\ncause  a  conflict  of  interest  with  his  security  obligations,  his  and  his  wife’s  close \\nrelationship to their family members in Russia raise a concern about his vulnerability or \\nsusceptibility to adverse foreign influence.

Applicant’s  familial  connections  in  Russia, \\ncoupled with the threat posed by the current Russian government to its own people and \\nthe security threat it poses to the United States, raises a heightened risk that Applicant \\ncould  be  subjected  to  adverse  foreign  influence.  Applicant  did  not  present  sufficient \\ninformation  to  mitigate  this  security  concern.  However,  this  adverse  finding  is  “not  a \\ncomment on Applicant’s patriotism but merely an acknowledgment that people may act \\nin unpredictable ways when faced with choices that could be important to a loved-one, \\nsuch as a family member.” ISCR Case No. 08-10025 at 4 (App. Bd.

       "The Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On\\nOctober 17, 2014, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\\ndecision–security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of\\nDefense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). Applicant  requested a hearing.\\nOn  November  21,  2015,  after  the  hearing,  Defense  Office  of  Hearings  and  Appeals  (DOHA)\\nAdministrative  Judge  Francisco  Mendez  denied  Applicant’s  request  for  a  security  clearance.\\nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive ¶¶ E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\\n\\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge’s adverse decision was\\n\\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\\n\\nThe Judge’s Findings of Fact\\n\\nThe Judge made the following findings pertinent to the issues raised on appeal.  Applicant\\nhas been continuously employed since 2004 and has held a clearance since 2008.  He owes the IRS\\nabout  $40,000  for  unpaid  taxes  from  tax  years  2005  through  2012  and  for  2014.1    Applicant\\nattributed his tax problems to his having spent funds on a wedding rather than his taxes, as well as\\nto inadequate withholding.  Over the past several years Applicant has entered into a number of\\ninstallment agreements with the IRS.  When he is unable to pay, he contacts the IRS and negotiates\\na new agreement.  Applicant has resolved other debts alleged in the SOR.  He has about $700 in\\ndiscretionary income each month.  His budget does not show any payments to the IRS.\\n\\nThe Judge’s Analysis\\n\\nThe Judge cleared Applicant of all SOR debts except those pertaining to his delinquent taxes.\\nHe noted that Applicant has been fully employed for many years but has consistently failed to pay\\nhis taxes in full.  The Judge noted that Applicant did not pay his 2014 taxes, which would have\\nbecome due after the receipt of the SOR.  The Judge concluded that not even the possible loss of a\\nsecurity clearance could motivate Applicant to change his financial habits.\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\nApplicant cites to evidence that he has resolved other SOR debts.  He also points to his latest\\nrepayment plan that, he argues, will enable him to resolve his tax delinquencies.  Applicant’s\\nargument is not sufficient to rebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the evidence in\\nthe record.  Neither is it sufficient to show that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was\\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-06093 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 4,\\n2015).  \\n\\n1The SOR alleged tax debts up through tax year 2011.  The Judge stated that he was considering the non-alleged\\n\\ndebts only in evaluating Applicant’s case for mitigation and the whole-person factors.  Decision at 3, note 7.  \\n\\n2\\n\\n\f",
       "Applicant requests an opportunity to present us with additional information about his budget,\\npayments to the IRS, and resolution of other debts.  His brief also refers to matters from outside the\\nrecord.  We are not able to consider new evidence on appeal.  Directive ¶ E3.1.29.  Applicant notes\\nthat the attorney who represented him at the hearing had requested the Judge not to consider several\\npages of the transcript due to a malfunction with the video-teleconference equipment.  The Judge\\nstated that he did not consider these pages.  Decision at 2, note 6.  Therefore, any technical problem\\nthat may have occurred did not impair Applicant’s receipt of due process.  \\n\\nThe Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the\\ndecision.  The decision is sustainable on this record.  “The general standard is that a clearance may\\nbe granted only when ‘clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.’”  Department\\nof the Navy v.

The  SOR  alleged  security \\nconcerns under Guidelines E (Personal Conduct), B (Foreign Influence), and M (Use of \\nInformation  Technology  Systems),  and  detailed  reasons  why  the  DOD  adjudicators \\nwere  unable  to  find  that  it  is  clearly  consistent  with  the  national  interest  to  grant  or \\ncontinue  a  security  clearance  for  Applicant.  The  SOR  recommended  referral  to  an \\nadministrative  judge  to  determine  whether  a  clearance  should  be  granted,  continued, \\ndenied, or revoked.  \\n\\n \\n \\nApplicant  received  the  SOR  on  January  28,  2015.  In  an  unsworn  declaration, \\ndated February 17, 2015,3 Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a \\nhearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel indicated the Government \\nwas prepared to proceed on August 3, 2015. The case was assigned to me on October \\n5, 2015. A Notice of Hearing was issued on October 28, 2015.

She refused \\nto  attend  Applicant’s  father’s  funeral  in  1995,  his  mother’s  funeral  in  1999,  his  college \\nreunion, or his niece’s wedding in 2008. He claimed  it got to the point where he asked \\nher  to  help  him  with  something  and  she  refused.  He  experienced  a  difficult  residence \\nreconstruction  project.  There  was  a  lack  of  communication  between  Applicant  and  his \\nwife.  After  the  separation,  attempted  reconciliations  failed.  During  the  period  of  his \\nseparation,  an  employer’s  contract  ended  and  his  position  was  vacated.  He  searched \\nfor  a  new  position,  and  actually  obtained  several  short-term  ones.  During  the  period \\n2004 until 2013, 18 friends or relatives passed away.

On  or  about  July  24,  2010,  Applicant  was \\nlooking through his personal e-mails on his government furnished equipment (GFE), a \\ncomputer,  and  accessed  some  online  dating  sites,  sports  sites,  and  book  sites. When \\nhe  opened  some  unsolicited  e-mails,  he  found  that  they  contained  photos  of  nude \\nwomen.  One  e-mail  contained  one  photo  of  five  nude  women  and  another  e-mail  had \\none  photo  which  he  considered  offensive,  but  did  not  describe.  He  claimed  that  if  he \\nhad  known  the  e-mails  contained  photos  of  nude  women,  he  would  not  have  opened \\nthem  on  his  office  GFE.  He  immediately  deleted  the  e-mails  after  conferring  with  a \\ncolleague.  Applicant  denied  that  he  ever  intentionally  used  his  GFE  to  look  at \\npornographic photos. This was the only time any of the e-mails he opened on his GFE \\ncontained photos of nude women. In addition, Applicant’s GFE computer screen saver \\nand  wall  paper  contained  approximately  eight  photos  of  his  scantly  clothed  girlfriend \\nwhich were not pornographic.11  \\n                                                           \\n \\n\\n7 GE 1, supra note 1, at 13; AE H (Diploma, dated May 23, 1981); AE F, supra note 4, at 1. \\n \\n8 GE 1, supra note 1, at 28-29; Tr. at 46 \\n \\n9 Tr. at 47-48. \\n \\n10 AE B (Biography, dated February 15, 2015), at 2-3; Applicant’s Answer to the SOR, supra note 3, at 3-5, \\n\\n8; Tr. at 29-33, 46-48, 53-54. \\n\\n \\n11 GE 3 (Personal Subject Interview, dated November 18, 2010), at 1-2; GE 3 (Personal Subject Interview, \\n\\ndated December 6, 2010), at 1; Tr. at 50-51, 54; Applicant’s Answer to the SOR, supra note 3, at 1-2. \\n\\n \\n3 \\n                                      \\n \\n\\n\f",
       "On  or  about  July  27,  2010,  one  of  Applicant’s  supervisors  approached  him  and \\nasked  to  see  the  photos  of  his  residence  reconstruction  project.  Applicant’s  GFE \\ncomputer wallpaper included photographs of his then-girlfriend in a bikini. After viewing \\nher photos and photos of the residence, the supervisor departed. What occurred next is \\nunclear.  Applicant  was  initially  of  the  belief  that  she  went  directly  to  the  information \\ntechnology  (IT)  department  and  asked  that  Applicant’s  GFE  computer  be  scanned. \\nThere is also some evidence that Applicant’s  GFE was merely randomly scanned. The \\nactual fact in this regard in unimportant. According to an incident report filed on July 30, \\n2010, the scan of Applicant’s GFE found that he had been accessing websites for online \\ndating which were characterized as “inappropriate,” as well as 15 photos that were also \\ncharacterized as “inappropriate.” Two of the photos were deemed “sexually explicit” and \\n“pornographic” in nature.12  \\n\\n \\nOn  July  28,  2010,  Applicant  was  terminated  from  his  employment  without \\nwarning due to “violation of company policy” and “unauthorized use of GFE for sexually \\nexplicit  or  sexually  oriented materials.”13  Although  the  SOR  alleged  that Applicant  was \\nterminated  from  employment  for  “viewing  pornographic  websites,”  the  evidence  upon \\nwhich  the  allegations  are  based,  the  Incident  History,  simply  refers  to  them  as \\n“inappropriate websites.”14 The two terms are not synonymous. \\n\\n \\nThere  is  no  IT  report  of  specific  findings,  a  report  of  investigation  by  the \\nemployer, a copy of the company policy supposedly violated by Applicant, copies of the \\ntroublesome  photographs,  or  explicit  descriptions  of  what  were  construed  as  sexually \\nexplicit  of  pornographic,  in  evidence.  There  is  no  evidence  of  any  subsequent  alleged \\nmisuse of GFE or violations of company policies.15 \\n\\n \\n\\nForeign Influence \\n \\n \\nOver  a  period  estimated  by  Applicant  to  be  15  months,  Applicant  chatted  with \\nvarious  foreign  individuals  while  playing  online  games  and  involved  in  online  dating.  He \\nexplained  that  to  be  successful  in  these  games,  it  was  necessary  to  “ally”  with  as  many \\nindividuals  as  possible  to  assist  him  in  winning.  The  games  required  communication  and \\noccasional  chats.  Applicant’s  online  dating  resulted  in  “relationships”  with  several  foreign \\nwomen, but none of those “relationships” involved physically seeing or meeting the women \\nexcept by telephone, or photographs and videos.  \\n \\n\\nOne such “relationship” with a woman in the Philippines in November 2009 involved \\nhis sending various sums of money to her via Western Union. Applicant’s two explanations \\nregarding  the  amounts  sent  her  are  inconsistent.  He  told  an  investigator  from  the  U.S. \\nOffice  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM)  in  October  2010  that  he  had  sent  her  $6,000  for \\nplane reservations, $7,000 for her father’s medical care, and $25 for support.  He changed \\n                                                                                                                                                                                           \\n\\n \\n12 Tr. at 82-83; GE 3 (Personal Subject Interview (November 18, 2010)), supra note 11, at 1. \\n \\n13 GE 2 (Incident Report, dated August 6, 2013). \\n \\n14 GE 2, supra note 13. \\n \\n15 Tr. at 56. \\n\\n \\n4 \\n                                      \\n \\n\\n\f",

He  changed  the  amounts  during  the  hearing,  and  said \\nhe sent her $2,000 for plane reservations. He added that he also sent her unspecified sums \\non  over  ten  occasions.

He changed the amounts during the hearing, and said he sent her $370 to \\nbuy  out  her  contract.

He sent her an unspecified sum of money to travel to the United States, but \\nshe used it for other purposes. When she requested additional money, he refused to send it \\nand the “relationship” ended.19 \\n\\n \\nApplicant  met  other  foreign  women  over  the  Internet,  but  none  of  those  involved \\nsending  money  to  them,  even  though  some  of  the  women  requested  money.

Once the Government has produced \\nsubstantial  evidence  of  a  disqualifying  condition,  under  Directive  ¶  E3.1.15,  the \\napplicant  has  the  burden  of  persuasion  to  present  evidence  in  refutation,  explanation, \\nextenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s \\ncase. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.36  \\n\\nthe  Government  predicated  upon \\n\\n \\nA  person  who  seeks  access  to  classified  information  enters  into  a  fiduciary \\ntrust  and  confidence.  This \\nrelationship  with \\nrelationship  transcends  normal  duty  hours  and  endures  throughout  off-duty  hours  as \\nwell.  It  is  because  of  this  special  relationship  that  the  Government  must  be  able  to \\nrepose  a  high  degree  of  trust  and  confidence  in  those  individuals  to  whom  it  grants \\naccess  to  classified  information.  Decisions  include,  by  necessity,  consideration  of  the \\npossible  risk  the applicant may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to safeguard  classified \\ninformation. Such decisions  entail  a  certain degree  of  legally  permissible  extrapolation \\nas  to  potential,  rather  than  actual,  risk  of  compromise  of  classified  information.  \\nFurthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of \\ndenials.”37 \\n\\n \\nClearance  decisions  must  be  “in  terms  of  the  national  interest  and  shall  in  no \\nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”38 Thus, nothing \\nin this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole \\nor in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, \\nor  patriotism.

Under  AG ¶ \\n40(e),  security  concerns  may  be  raised  by  the  “unauthorized  use  of  a  government  or \\nother  information  technology  system.”  This  guideline  generally  refers  to  sending  or \\nsoliciting sexually-oriented messages or images, or the downloading, creating, storing, \\nor  displaying  computer  files  of  a  sexual  nature.  In  mid-2010,  Applicant  opened  an \\nInternet  site  on  his  GFE  that  his  employer  considered  an  “inappropriate”  website.  The \\nsole  evidence  pertaining  to  it  was  the  name,  and  that  name,  without  more,  seems  to \\nindicate  it  was  an  online  dating  website.  There  is  zero  evidence  that  it  was  a \\n“pornographic”  website.  In  July  2010,  while  he  was  again  on  the  GFE,  he opened  two \\nunsolicited  e-mails  addressed  to  him.  One  of  the  e-mails  contained  photos  of  nude \\nwomen  and  the  other  contained  a  photo  of  what  he  considered  offensive.  Applicant \\npromptly  deleted  the  e-mails.  He  also  had  photos  of  his  scantily  clad  girlfriend  on  his \\nscreen saver and wall paper. A subsequent computer scan of his GFE conducted by the \\nIT department revealed the access to the “inappropriate” website as well as the photos \\nthat  were  characterized  as  “inappropriate.”  Two  of  the  photos  were  deemed  “explicit” \\nand  “pornographic”  in  nature.  As  a  result,  the  following  day,  Applicant  was  terminated \\nfrom his employment due to “violation of company policy” and “unauthorized use of GFE \\nfor sexually explicit or sexually oriented materials.” AG ¶ 40(e) has been established. \\n \\n \\nThe  guideline  also  includes  examples  of  conditions  that  could  mitigate  such \\nsecurity  concerns.  Under  AG  ¶  41(a),  the  disqualifying  condition  may  be  mitigated \\nwhere  “so much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it happened under \\nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \\nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.” Similarly, AG ¶ 41(c) applies \\nwhere  “the  conduct  was  unintentional  or  inadvertent  and  was  followed  by  a  prompt, \\ngood-faith effort to correct the situation and by notification of supervisor.”  \\n \\n \\nWhile  Applicant  did  not  promptly  notify  his  supervisor,  he  did  confer  with  a \\ncolleague to determine what to do, and he immediately deleted the e-mails in an effort \\nto correct the situation. According to the apparent prevailing community standards, the \\nemployer  considered  two  of  the  photos  to  be  “sexually  explicit”  and  “pornographic”  in \\n\\n \\n9 \\n                                      \\n \\n\\n\f",

AG ¶¶ 16(c) and 16(e) have been partially established.  \\n\\n \\nThe  guideline  also  includes  examples  of  conditions  that  could  mitigate  security \\nconcerns  arising  from  personal  conduct.  AG  ¶  17(c)  may  apply  if  “the  offense  is  so \\nminor,  or  so  much  time  has  passed,  or  the  behavior  is  so  infrequent,  or  it  happened \\nunder such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on \\nthe individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.”  \\n\\n \\nSimilarly, AG ¶ 17(d) may apply if “the individual has acknowledged the behavior \\nand  obtained  counseling  to  change  the  behavior  or  taken  other  positive  steps  to \\nalleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \\nor  other  inappropriate  behavior,  and  such  behavior  is  unlikely  to  recur.”  Also,  if  “the \\nindividual  has  taken  positive  steps  to  reduce  or  eliminate  vulnerability  to  exploitation, \\nmanipulation, or duress,” AG ¶ 17(e) may apply. \\n\\n  \\nIn  July  2010,  during  a  period  when  Applicant  was  under  substantial  emotional \\nstress,  he  was  involuntarily  terminated  from  his  employment  due  to  “violation  of \\ncompany policy” and “unauthorized use of GFE for sexually explicit or sexually oriented \\nmaterials.” The alleged behavior, both the viewing of an “inappropriate website as well \\nas  the  opening  of  unsolicited  e-mails  each  occurred  on  one  occasion,  over  four  and \\none-half years before the SOR was issued. Applicant took positive efforts to reduce or \\neliminate  the  behavior  of  online  dating  and  game-playing.  He  remarried.

There  is  no  evidence  of  any \\nsubsequent  alleged  personal  conduct.  Considering  the  fact  that  the  “inappropriate” \\nwebsite dealt with online dating, and not pornography, the significance of the personal \\nconduct  is  minimized.  Applicant  has  reduced  or  eliminated  his  vulnerability  to \\nexploitation, and through his rehabilitative efforts, the  alleged untrustworthy, unreliable, \\nor other inappropriate behavior, is unlikely to recur. AG ¶¶ 17(c), 17(d), and 17(e) apply. \\n \\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \\n \\n\\nThe security concern under the Foreign Influence guideline is set out in AG ¶ 6:       \\n\\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \\nany  foreign  interest.  Adjudication  under  this  Guideline  can  and  should \\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \\nfinancial \\nto,  such \\nconsiderations  as  whether  the  foreign  country  is  known  to  target  United \\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \\nrisk of terrorism. \\n\\nincluding,  but  not \\n\\ninterest \\n\\nis \\n\\nlocated, \\n\\nlimited \\n\\n \\n\\n11 \\n\\n                                      \\n \\n\\n\f",
       "The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \\nAG  ¶  7(a),  it  is  potentially  disqualifying  where  there  is  “contact  with  a  foreign  family \\nmember, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of \\nor  resident  in  a  foreign  country  if  that  contact  creates  a  heightened  risk  of  foreign \\nexploitation,  inducement,  manipulation,  pressure,  or  coercion.”  Similarly,  under  AG  ¶ \\n7(e), security concerns may be raised when there is  “a substantial business, financial, \\nor  property  interest  in  a  foreign  country,  or  in  any  foreign-owned  or  foreign-operated \\nbusiness,  which  could  subject  the  individual  to  heightened  risk  of  foreign  influence  or \\nexploitation.  \\n\\nApplicant  is  not  a  naturalized  U.S.  citizen.  He  was  born  in  the  United  States  of \\nparents  who  were  also  born  in  the  United  States.  His  entire  immediate  and  extended \\nfamily members are also U.S. citizens. There is no evidence (or allegations) that he has \\nany  family  members  or  business  or  professional  associates  who  are  citizens  or \\nresidents of a foreign  country. In 2009 and 2010, he did, however, have long-distance \\nonline and telephone relationships with several women who were foreign-born residents \\nof  various  countries.  Although  he  never  physically  saw  or  met  the  women,  except  by \\ntelephone, photographs, or videos, he did send them various sums of money, estimated \\nto  be  a  total  in  excess  of  $60,000,  allegedly  earmarked  by  the  recipients  for \\ntransportation,  medical  care,  support,  and  release \\nfrom  a  customs.  Applicant \\nacknowledged that some of the women were taking advantage of him in scams, but he \\nwas not aware of the truth until later. He denied having a bond of affection, loyalty, or \\nfriendship  obligation  for  any  of  the  foreign  nationals  with  whom  he  had  the \\naforementioned “relationships.”   \\n\\nApplicant’s online dating and gaming forays with foreign women ceased in 2011 \\nwhen  he  met  the  woman  who  eventually  became  his  second  wife.  The  security \\nsignificance  of  these  identified  conditions  requires  further  examination  of  Applicant’s \\nformer  foreign  “relationships”  to  determine  the  degree  of  “heightened  risk”  or  potential \\nconflict  of  interest.  Furthermore,  Department  Counsel  argued  that  Applicant’s  actions \\nrevealed  cloudy  judgment,  a  lack  of  self-discipline,  and  a  vulnerability    to  possible \\nmanipulation and exploitation.  The SOR alleged that Applicant wired money to various \\noversea  locations  “in  an  attempt  to  incite  the  relationships.”  (Emphasis  added).40  The \\nevidence  is  persuasive  that,  after  nearly  three  decades  of  marriage  and  a  separation \\nand pending divorce, Applicant was active in online dating and simply wished to make \\nthe right social connection with a female. Nevertheless, AG ¶¶ 7(a) and 7(e) are partially \\nestablished. \\n\\nThe  guideline  also  includes  examples  of  conditions  that  could  mitigate  security \\nconcerns  arising  from  foreign  influence.  Under  AG  ¶  8(a),  the  disqualifying  condition \\nmay be mitigated where: \\n\\n                                                           \\n\\n40  It  is  unclear  why  the  word  “incite”  was  used  in  the  SOR  for  that  word  generally  conveys  a  negative \\nimplication, such as to stir up, fan the flames of, provoke, inflame, egg on, whip up, or foment. The evidence seems to \\ninfer another meaning such as encourage, kindle, arouse, or stimulate.  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n12 \\n\\n                                      \\n \\n\\n\f",

One  such  factor  is  the  potential  for  pressure,  coercion, \\nexploitation,  or  duress.  In  that  regard,  it  is  important  to  realize  that  Applicant  never \\nintended to, and did not, leave the U.S. to enter any of the foreign countries, and that \\nhis  sole  intent  was  to  have  individuals  travel  to  the  U.S.  for  brief  visits  to  explore \\npossible continuing relationships. In fact, none of those foreign women ever entered the \\nU.S., and their sole purpose was seemingly to scam money from Applicant. Yes, he did \\nsend the women substantial sums of money, but any “relationships” that he might have \\ndeveloped with them ceased in 2010 or 2011, at least four years before the SOR was \\nissued.  In  those  circumstances,  there  is  very  little  potential  for  pressure,  coercion, \\nexploitation, or duress.  \\n\\n \\nApplicant’s  immediate  family  and  extended  family  still  reside  in  the  U.S.,  and \\nthose  foreign  women  still  remain  overseas  without  any  continuing  contact  with \\nApplicant.  There  is  no  risk,  much  less  a  “heightened  risk,”  of  foreign  exploitation, \\ninducement,  manipulation,  pressure,  or  coercion  to  disqualify  Applicant  from  holding  a \\nsecurity  clearance  because  of  any  close  or  continuing  relationship  with  those  foreign \\nwomen.  While  Applicant  may  have  been  somewhat  naive,  and  displayed  a  lack  of \\njudgment, in falling for scams and sending such large sums of money to strangers, I am \\npersuaded that Applicant’s loyalty to the United States is steadfast and undivided, and \\nthat he has “such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that [he] \\ncan be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.” AG ¶¶ \\n8(a), 8(b), and 8(f) apply. \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n13 \\n\\n                                      \\n \\n\\n\f",

The  administrative  judge  should  consider  the  nine \\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  \\n \\n\\nthe  nature,  extent,  and  seriousness  of \\nto \\n\\nthe \\nthe  conduct;  (2) \\n(1) \\ncircumstances  surrounding \\ninclude  knowledgeable \\nparticipation;  (3)  the  frequency  and  recency  of  the  conduct;  (4)  the \\nindividual’s  age  and maturity  at  the  time  of the  conduct;  (5)  the  extent to \\nwhich  participation \\nthe  presence  or  absence  of \\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \\nfor  the  conduct;  (8)  the  potential  for  pressure,  coercion,  exploitation,  or \\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \\n\\nthe  conduct, \\n\\nis  voluntary;  (6) \\n\\n \\nUnder AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \\nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have evaluated the various \\naspects  of this  case  in  light  of the  totality  of  the  record evidence and have  not merely \\nperformed a piecemeal analysis.41       \\n\\nThere  is  some  evidence  against  mitigating  Applicant’s  use  of  information \\ntechnology  systems,  personal  conduct,  and  foreign  influence  concerns.  Applicant  was \\ninvoluntarily  terminated  from  his  employment  due  to  “violation  of  company  policy”  and \\n“unauthorized  use  of  GFE  for  sexually  explicit  or  sexually  oriented  materials.”  The  IT \\nscan  of  Applicant’s  GFE  revealed  that  he  viewed  an  “inappropriate”  online  dating \\nwebsite,  and on one occasion  in  July  2010, he  opened  two  unsolicited  e-mails,  one of \\nwhich  happened  to  contain  photos  of  nude  women,  and  the  other  of  which  contained \\nsomething  that  he  considered  “offensive.”  In  2009  and  2010,  he  engaged  in  long-\\ndistance online and telephone relationships with several women who were foreign-born \\nresidents of various countries. He sent them various sums of money, estimated to be a \\ntotal  in  excess  of  $60,000,  allegedly  earmarked  by  the  recipients  for  transportation, \\nmedical care, support, and release from a customs.  \\n\\nThe  mitigating  evidence  under  the  whole-person  concept  is  more  substantial. \\nApplicant’s alleged behavior occurred over four and one-half years before the SOR was \\nissued, and there is no evidence of subsequent conduct of a similar nature. There is no \\nevidence  of  a  personality  disorder.  Applicant  has  a  good  reputation  for  reliability, \\ntrustworthiness,  good  moral  character,  integrity,  discretion,  loyalty,  honesty,  efficiency, \\nprofessionalism,  problem-solving  skills,  and  a  strong  work  ethic.  He  was  active  in  his \\ncommunity,  and  served  as  a  middle  school  basketball  coach,  as  well  as  a  basketball \\nreferee and baseball umpire for 12 years. He was also active in the community chapters \\nof  several  national  service  organizations  integrity  and  trustworthiness.

He  first  began  working  for  that  contractor  in  about \\nFebruary  2010,  but  subsequently  has  been  employed  by  other  companies.  He \\ngraduated  from  high  school  in  2002,  attended  college  without  earning  a  degree,  and \\nqualified as an emergency medical technician (EMT). From 2002 to 2008, he served in \\nthe  Army  National  Guard,  achieved  the  grade  of  specialist  (E-4),  and  received  an \\nhonorable discharge. He deployed to Iraq from January 2007 to February 2008. He is \\ndivorced  and  has  a  child  who  is  nine  years  old.  He  was  first  granted  a  security \\nclearance in 2004.2 \\n \\n\\nThe  SOR  alleged  under  Guideline  K  that  Applicant  committed  three  security \\nviolations in 2010 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.c). Under Guideline E, the SOR alleged the he was \\ncharged with assault on a family member in 2009 (SOR ¶ 2.a); that he was terminated \\nfrom a job during a probationary period in 2009 (SOR ¶ 2.b); that he was counseled for \\nneglect of duty and falsification in 2009 (SOR ¶ 2.c); that he illegally gained access to a \\nhotel in 2009 (SOR ¶ 2.d); that he was returned early from an overseas assignment and \\nplaced  on  probation  in  2010  (SOR  2.e);  and  that  he  falsified  his  responses  to  two \\nquestions in an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) (SOR ¶¶ \\n2.f and 2.g). The allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.c were also cross-alleged under Guideline \\nE in a single allegation (SOR ¶ 2.h). In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the \\nallegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.c, and 2.a-2.e, did not respond to the allegation in SOR ¶ \\n2.h, and denied the remaining allegations.3 \\n \\n                                                           \\n\\n1 Tr. 10-11, 42. \\n\\n2 Tr. 5-6, 62, 65, 92-93, 102-104; GE 1, 2. \\n\\n3 Applicant’s Answer to the SOR. \\n\\n \\n2 \\n \\n \\n\\n\f",
       "SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.c,  2.e,  and  2.h  –  three  security  violations  in  a  two-month \\nperiod,  being  returned  from  an  overseas  assignment  without  completing  a \\ncontract,  and  being  placed  on  probation  in  2010.  From  March  to  April  2010, \\nApplicant worked as a security guard for a company [hereafter referred to as “Company \\nA”]  at  an  overseas  location.  In  that  job,  his  duties  included  verifying  the  eligibility  of \\nthose seeking access to controlled spaces and classified information. \\n\\n \\nOn March 1, 2010, a team leader at Company A issued a memorandum for the \\nrecord (MFR) that reflected Applicant closed, but did not lock, a safe in a secured space \\nand failed to record properly the opening and closing of the safe and the logging in and \\nout of classified documents. (Allegation in SOR 1.a). Applicant was counseled to ensure \\nthat  all  procedures  were  followed,  especially  those  concerning  the  safeguarding  of \\nclassified \\ninstances  of  unsatisfactory \\nperformance  would  result  in  more  severe  corrective  action.  The  MFR  reflected  it  was \\nplaced in “personnel file,” but it does not contain Applicant’s signature or any indication \\nthat he was shown it or informed about it.4 \\n\\ninformation,  and  admonished \\n\\nthat \\n\\nfurther \\n\\n \\nApplicant testified that he never willfully violated any security protocol that was \\nproperly  explained  to  him.  This  incident  occurred  soon  after  he  began  working  for \\nCompany A. He arrived at the overseas location less than 48 hours before the incident. \\nIt happened his first day on the job. He claimed that he was not given proper guidance \\non the opening and closing of the safe. The safe was not secure because he failed to \\nspin the lock dial. The safe was located in a secure room and the classified information \\nwas not subject to compromise. Additionally, a person cleared for classified information \\nsigned out a document, but Applicant did not know there was a part of the document \\nthat he was required to fill out. He acknowledged that he made mistakes because he did \\nnot ask enough questions and stated he did not thereafter make those same mistakes \\nagain.5 \\n \\nOn March 10, 2010, a team leader at Company A issued a MFR that reflected \\nApplicant failed to follow orders by permitting a non-cleared worker to have access to \\nthe controlled access area (CAA) without verifying the worker was on the CAA access \\nroster. (Allegation in SOR ¶ 1.b). Applicant was questioned about this security violation \\nand  stated  that  he  recognized  the  worker.  The  MFR  noted  that  the  worker  had  just \\nreturned from a leave of absence and had not yet been placed back on the CAA access \\nroster.  The  MFR  also  indicated  that  it  would  serve  as  a  written  reprimand  of \\nunsatisfactory performance. The MFR reflected it was placed in “personnel file,” but it \\ndoes  not  contain  Applicant’s  signature  or  any  indication  that  he  was  shown  it  or \\ninformed about it.6 \\n                                                           \\n\\n4 GE 2, 3. \\n\\n5 Tr. 13, 21-34, 41; GE 2; Applicant’s Answer to the SOR. \\n\\n6 GE 2, 4.

       "Applicant testified that this was his second day working at a particular post. He \\nstated  that  he  read  the  wrong  weekly  CAA  access  roster  at  the  post  and  the  non-\\ncleared worker was listed on that roster. This was an outdated access roster. Applicant \\nclaimed  that,  due  to  a  clerical  error,  the  individual  was  not  added  to  the  most  recent \\naccess roster. He claimed he recognized the individual as being a person on the access \\nroster from the previous day, but that was the wrong access roster. When the error was \\ndiscovered,  the  old  roster  was  taken  away  and  a  new  roster  was  issued  with  the \\nindividual in question added to it. Applicant stated his team leader  was upset that he \\nhad not checked the latest access roster. He was counseled for this incident, but did not \\nremember receiving a written warning at that time.7 \\n\\n \\nOn  April  19,  2010,  a  team  leader  at  Company  A  issued  a  MFR  that  reflected \\nApplicant failed to conduct properly a page inventory of classified documents on April \\n17,  2010.  (Allegation  in  SOR  ¶  1.c).  The  MFR  noted  that  two  of  the  documents  had \\nbeen  previously  combined  and  another  had  48  pages  removed  for  destruction. \\nApplicant’s  inventory  failed  to  account  for  the  missing  pages.  He  was  asked  how  he \\nconducted the inventory and responded by saying he conducted a page-by-page count. \\nWhen asked to explain the discrepancy involving the missing pages, he acknowledged \\nhis mistake. The MFR reflected it was placed in “personnel file,” but it does not contain \\nApplicant’s signature or any indication that he was shown it or informed about it.8 \\n\\n \\n \\nIn his background interview, Applicant stated that he counted the pages. At the \\nhearing, he testified that every week a  document inventory was conducted and every \\nmonth a more extensive page-by-page document inventory was conducted. He stated \\nthat he made the mistake of believing this inventory was the weekly document inventory \\ninstead  of  the  monthly  page-by-page  inventory.  He  claimed  the  team  leader  had \\nimproperly taken the missing pages and stored them in his room without logging them \\nout.  He  believed  the  team  leader  was  setting  a  trap  for  the  guard  conducting  the \\ninventory.  This  incident  resulted  in  a  conflict  between  him  and  the  team  leader.  He \\ncontacted the program manager and reported that the team leader improperly handled \\ndocuments. He also indicated that he wrote a detailed rebuttal to the counseling.9 \\n \\n \\nShortly after the incident on April 17, 2010, Applicant was sent home before the \\ncompletion  of  his  contract.  A  payroll  document  reflected  “[h]e  is  on  probation.  Please \\nhold  pay.”  (Allegation  in  SOR  ¶  2.e).  He  stated  that  he  received  all  of  the  written \\nwarnings/reprimands when he was leaving this overseas location. He further stated that \\nhe was so upset about being sent home that he did not read the documents that were \\ngiven to him. He did not consider his return to the United States as a termination. His \\nprogram  manager  led  him  believe  that  he  was  sent  back  because  of  the  personality \\n                                                           \\n\\n7 Tr. 34-42; GE 2; Applicant’s Answer to the SOR. \\n\\n8 GE 2, 5.

On January 9, \\n \\n2009, Applicant was issued a summons to appear in court for the charge of assault on a \\nfamily member, a Class 1 misdemeanor. On April 28, 2009, Applicant pleaded not guilty \\nto the charge. The court found there were sufficient facts to establish guilt but deferred \\nadjudication  for  one  year.

He testified that he never hit his ex-wife before \\nor after that incident.12 \\n \\n\\nSOR ¶ 2.b – termination from a job during a probationary period in March \\n2009.  In  his  e-QIP,  Applicant  disclosed  that  he  was  terminated  from  a  security  guard \\nposition with Company B near the end of a six-month probationary period. Company B \\nwas  not  required  to  provide  an  explanation  for  the  termination  during  that  period.  He \\nnoted that he was accused of wearing an earbud linked to an unauthorized MP3 player \\nwhile at work. He stated the earbud was for a cell phone that was permitted. He also \\nindicated  that  this  incident  happened  about  a  month  before  his  probationary  period \\nended, and he was never written up for this incident.13  \\n\\n \\nApplicant testified that he believed that he was terminated from the probationary \\nposition because of the pending domestic-violence charge. If he was convicted of the \\ncharge, he would have been prohibited from carrying a firearm at work. If he continued \\nto  work  for  Company  B  beyond  the  probationary  period,  he  would  have  become  a \\nmember of the employee’s union and the company would have had to hire an attorney \\nto  remove  him  from  the  job  if  he  could  no  longer  carry  a  firearm.

Usually the guards would rotate between the posts each night. On the night in \\nquestion, however, the schedule did not rotate the guards between the posts.

While working for Company C overseas from July to December 2009, Applicant \\nresided in a hotel. The hotel was connected to a mall. There was a sliding door from the \\nmall  to  the  hotel.  After  a  certain  time  each  night,  the  door  was  secured.  On  two \\noccasions, Applicant went through the sliding door after it was secured. He claimed that \\nhe was given permission from the guard in the mall to use the door on both occasions. \\nAfter the second occasion, the hotel management was upset and threatened to kick out \\nall of the U.S. contractors from the hotel. Company C agreed to send Applicant back to \\nthe United States to appease the hotel. He acknowledged that he was given a written \\nwarning because of this incident. He also stated that he did not consider it a termination \\nbecause he was told it was not his fault and the company would find him another job. \\nHe met with a company representative for another job opportunity overseas, but soon \\nthereafter his father passed away and his mother was in the hospital, which precluded \\nhim  from  taking  that  job.  In  his  e-QIP,  he  did  not  list  the  reason  for  termination  of \\nemployment with Company C. Two months later he accepted employment with another \\nemployer, Company A.17 \\n\\n \\nSOR ¶¶ 2.f and 2.g – falsification allegations. Applicant submitted his e-QIP \\non October 14, 2010.

Department of the Navy v. \\nEgan,  484  U.S.  518,  527  (1988).  The  President  has  authorized  the  Secretary  of \\nDefense to grant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it \\nis clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \\nClassified  Information  within  Industry  §  2  (Feb.  20,  1960),  as  amended.  The  U.S. \\nSupreme  Court  has  recognized  the  substantial  discretion  of  the  Executive  Branch  in \\nregulating  access  to  information  pertaining  to  national  security,  emphasizing  that  “no \\none  has  a  ‘right’  to  a  security  clearance.”  Department  of  the  Navy  v.  Egan,  484  U.S. \\n518, 528 (1988). \\n\\n \\nEligibility  for  a  security  clearance  is  predicated  upon  the  applicant  meeting  the \\ncriteria contained in the AGs. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \\nrecognizing  the  complexities  of  human  behavior,  these  guidelines  are  applied  in \\nconjunction  with  an  evaluation  of  the  whole  person.  An  administrative  judge’s \\nadjudicative  goal  is  a  fair,  impartial,  and  commonsense  decision.  An  administrative \\njudge  must  consider  all  available,  reliable  information  about  the  person,  past  and \\npresent, favorable and unfavorable, to reach his decision.  \\n                                                           \\n\\n24 Tr. 96-104. \\n\\n25 Tr. 103-104; GE 1, 2 at 18-19.  \\n\\n26 AE A-F. \\n\\n \\n8 \\n \\n \\n\\n\f",
       "The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \\naccess  to  classified  information.  This  relationship  transcends  normal  duty  hours  and \\nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \\npossible  risk  that  the  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  safeguard \\nclassified  information.  Such  decisions  entail  a  certain  degree  of  legally  permissible \\nextrapolation  of  potential,  rather  than  actual,  risk  of  compromise  of  classified \\ninformation. Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in \\nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. \\nOr.  10865  §  7.  See  also  Executive  Order  12968  (Aug.  2,  1995),  Section  3.  Thus,  a \\nclearance  decision  is  merely  an  indication  that  the  Applicant  has  or  has  not  met  the \\nstrict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing \\na clearance. \\n\\n \\nInitially,  the  Government  must  establish,  by  substantial  evidence,  conditions  in \\nthe  personal  or  professional  history  of  the  applicant  that  may  disqualify  the  applicant \\nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \\nof  establishing  controverted  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  See  Egan,  484  U.S.  at  531.  \\n“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. \\nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \\npresume  a  nexus  or  rational  connection  between  proven  conduct  under  any  of  the \\ncriteria listed and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \\n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \\n\\n \\nOnce  the  Government  establishes  a  disqualifying  condition  by  substantial \\nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \\nfacts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \\nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue [his or her] security \\nclearance.”  ISCR  Case  No.  01-20700  at  3  (App.  Bd.  Dec.  19,  2002).  The  burden  of \\ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. \\n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd.

       "(g) any failure to comply with rules for the protection of classified or other \\nsensitive information; and  \\n \\n(h)  negligent  or  lax  security  habits  that  persist  despite  counseling  by \\nmanagement.  \\n \\n \\nIn early 2010, Applicant committed a number of security violations that resulted in \\nhim  being  issued  written  warnings  and  being  returned  early  from  an  overseas \\nassignment. AG ¶¶ 34(g) and 34(h) apply. \\n \\n \\n¶ 35: \\n \\n\\nThere are three handling of protected information mitigating conditions under AG \\n\\n(a)  so  much  time  has  elapsed  since  the  behavior,  or  it  happened  so \\ninfrequently  or  under  such  unusual  circumstances,  that  it  is  unlikely  to \\nrecur  and  does  not  cast  doubt  on \\nreliability, \\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;  \\n \\n(b) the individual responded favorably to counseling or remedial security \\ntraining and now demonstrates a positive attitude toward the discharge of \\nsecurity responsibilities; and \\n \\n(c)  the security violations were due to improper or inadequate training. \\n\\nindividual’s \\n\\nthe \\n\\n \\n \\nAs  the  Appeal  Board  has  stated,  once  it  is  established  that  an  applicant  has \\ncommitted security violations, he or she has a “very heavy burden” of persuasion as to \\nmitigation.  Such  violations  “strike  at  the  heart  of  the  industrial  security  program.” \\nAccordingly,  a  judge  must  give  any  claims  of  reform  or  rehabilitation  “strict  scrutiny.” \\nISCR Case No. 11-09219 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 31, 2014).   \\n \\n \\nThe conduct in question happened over six years ago. While Applicant has not \\ncommitted any other security violation since then, this conduct should not be considered \\nin  isolation,  but  should  be  examined  in  relation  to  his  other  questionable  conduct  as \\nalleged under Guideline E. When viewed in  that manner, I am unable to find that his \\nconduct  happened  so  long  ago,  was  so  infrequent,  or  occurred  under  unusual \\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur. In reaching this conclusion, I also considered \\nthat the security violations happened shortly after he started a new job and he claimed \\nhe had not received adequate training. Nevertheless, I find that his security violations \\ncontinue  to  cast  doubt  on  his  reliability,  trustworthiness,  and  good  judgment.  None  of \\nthe mitigating conditions fully apply.  \\n \\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \\n \\n\\n \\n\\nAG ¶ 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct:  \\n \\n\\n \\n10 \\n \\n \\n\\n\f",
       "Conduct  involving  questionable  judgment,  lack  of  candor,  dishonesty,  or \\nunwillingness  to  comply  with  rules  and  regulations  can  raise  questions \\nabout  an  individual's  reliability,  trustworthiness  and  ability  to  protect \\nclassified information. \\n \\nAG  ¶  16  describes  conditions  that  could  raise  security  concerns  and  may  be \\n\\ndisqualifying in this case:  \\n\\n \\n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \\nany  personnel  security  questionnaire,  personal  history  statement,  or \\nsimilar  form  used  to  conduct  investigations,  determine  employment \\nqualifications,  award  benefits  or  status,  determine  security  eligibility  or \\ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;  \\n \\n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \\nnot  sufficient  for  an  adverse  determination  under  any  other  single \\nguideline,  but  which,  when  considered  as  a  whole,  supports  a  whole-\\nperson  assessment  of  questionable \\njudgment,  untrustworthiness, \\nunreliability,  lack  of  candor,  unwillingness  to  comply  with  rules  and \\nregulations,  or  other  characteristics  indicating  that  the  person  may  not \\nproperly safeguard protected information; and \\n \\n(d)  credible  adverse  information  that  is  not  explicitly  covered  under  any \\nother  guideline  and  may  not  be  sufficient  by  itself  for  an  adverse \\ndetermination,  but  which,  when  combined  with  all  available  evidence \\ninformation  supports  a  whole-person  assessment  of  questionable \\njudgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to \\ncomply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that \\nthe  person  may  not  properly  safeguard  protected  information.  This \\nincludes  but  is  not  limited  to  consideration  of:  (1)  untrustworthy  or \\nunreliable behavior. . . ; (3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; (4) \\nevidence of significant misuse of Government or other employer’s time or \\nresources. \\n \\nI  did  not  find  Applicant’s  testimony  convincing  that  he  forgot  about  the  written \\nwarnings he received for the security violations in 2010 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.c), or the written \\ncounseling he received for dereliction of duty and falsification of a document in 2009. \\nThe security violations happened about six month before he submitted his e-QIP. Due \\nto  those  security  violations,  he  was  sent  home  from  an  overseas  location,  placed  on \\nprobation, and was not employed for the intervening six months. It is not believable that \\nhe would have forgotten about those recent events when he submitted his e-QIP at the \\nstart of his next job. His claim that he did not have the records or written warnings with \\nhim  when  he  submitted  the  e-QIP  is  likewise  not  persuasive.  I  find  that  Applicant \\ndeliberately falsified his 2010 e-QIP when he failed to disclose those written warnings \\nand counseling. AG ¶ 16(a) applies.  \\n\\n \\n11 \\n \\n \\n\\n\f",

Specifically,  Applicant  was \\napproximately $95,326 past due on a mortgage (SOR ¶ 1.a: Item 6 at 2; Item 7 at 2); he \\nowed a $654 judgement entered against him in November 2009 on behalf of a hospital \\n(SOR  ¶  1.b:  Item  6  at  1;  Item  7  at  1;  Item  9  at  1);  and  he  filed  for  bankruptcy  under \\nChapter  7  in  June  2010.  The  Chapter  7  bankruptcy  was  converted  to  a  Chapter  13 \\nbankruptcy. (SOR ¶ 1.c: Item 5 at 1; Item 6 at 1; Item 7 at 1; Item 10).   \\n\\n \\nIn  his  response  to  the  SOR,  dated  December  11,  2014,  Applicant  admits  to  all \\nallegations,  but  claims  the  debts  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.b  are  included  in  his \\nbankruptcy.    The  Chapter  13  bankruptcy  repayment  plan  required  him  to  pay  $164 \\npayments over a period of 60 months. Applicant indicated he is timely making payments \\nand will continue to do so until the plan is complete in August 2015. (Item 2 at 6)  \\n\\n \\nIn a response to Interrogatories, dated July 15, 2013, Applicant indicated that he \\nfiled for bankruptcy because of his divorce from his second wife in 2009 and as a result \\nof business deal that went bad. He built seven houses for a contractor and was never \\npaid.  He  believes  one  of  the  creditors  (a  mortgage)  included  in  his  bankruptcy  is  the \\nsame as the mortgage alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a. (Item 4 at 9)  \\n\\n \\nApplicant  received  financial  counseling  as  a  requirement  of  his  bankruptcy \\nprocess.  (Item  4  at  13,  25-29)  In  July  2013,  he  also  completed  a  personal  financial \\nworksheet.  His  net  monthly  income  was  $2,851.  He  had  $2,297  in  total  monthly \\nexpenses. After expenses, he had $554 left over in discretionary income. (Item 4 at 22)  \\n\\n \\nIn his response to the FORM, Applicant provided all of his Chapter 13 bankruptcy \\npaperwork. He completed his payment plan and the Chapter 13 bankruptcy is complete. \\nHe  provided  a  copy  of  the  Discharge  of  Debtor  After  Completion  of  Chapter  13  Plan, \\ndated  September  28,  2015.  He  provided  a  copy  of  his  payment  history.  He  also \\nprovided a portion of a TransUnion credit report which indicates the debt alleged in SOR \\n¶  1.b  was  included  in  the  Chapter  13  bankruptcy.  He  is  still  not  sure  where  the \\nmortgage debt came from. It is no longer on his credit report and his attorney assures \\nhim that it was included in the bankruptcy. (Item 12)    \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n2 \\n \\n \\n\\n\f",
       "He said he has made his share of mistakes, but has done everything he could to \\nrectify  the  situation.    Everything  he  does  is  motivated  by  making  his  children’s  lives \\nbetter.  He  explained  he  became  bankrupt  as  a  result  of  his  previous  job  in  the \\nconstruction  business.  Applicant  built  houses.  His  business  partners  backed  out  when \\nthe real estate business slowed down and left Applicant with thousands of unpaid bills. \\nAt  the  same  time,  his  ex-wife  incurred  some  bills  that  he  could  not  afford  to  repay. \\nApplicant is now able to pay his bills. His pay has increased an additional $8 an hour. \\n(Item 12) \\n   \\n\\nPolicies \\n\\n \\n\\nWhen  evaluating  an  applicant’s  suitability \\n\\n \\nthe \\nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \\nintroductory  explanations  for  each  guideline,  the  adjudicative  guidelines  list  potentially \\ndisqualifying  conditions  and  mitigating  conditions,  which  must  be  considered  when \\ndetermining an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. \\n\\nfor  a  security  clearance, \\n\\n \\nThese  guidelines  are  not  inflexible  rules  of  law.  Instead,  recognizing  the \\ncomplexities  of  human  behavior,  these  guidelines  are  applied  in  conjunction  with  the \\nfactors  listed  in  the  adjudicative  process.  The  administrative  judge’s  overarching \\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 2(c), \\nthe  entire  process  is  a  conscientious  scrutiny  of  a  number  of  variables  known  as  the \\n“whole-person  concept.”  The  administrative  judge  must  consider  all  available,  reliable \\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \\ndecision. \\n\\n \\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) \\nrequires  that  “[a]ny  doubt  concerning  personnel  being  considered  for  access  to \\nclassified  information  will  be  resolved  in  favor  of  national  security.”  In  reaching  this \\ndecision,  I  have  drawn  only  those  conclusions  that  are  reasonable,  logical,  and  based \\non the evidence contained in the record.  \\n\\n \\nUnder  Directive  ¶  E3.1.14,  the  Government  must  present  evidence  to  establish \\ncontroverted  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  Under  Directive  ¶  E3.1.15,  the  applicant  is \\nresponsible  for  presenting  “witnesses  and  other  evidence  to  rebut,  explain,  extenuate, \\nor  mitigate  facts  admitted  by  applicant  or  proven  by  Department  Counsel.  .  .  .”  The \\napplicant  has  the  ultimate  burden  of  persuasion  as  to  obtaining  a  favorable  security \\ndecision.  \\n\\nthe  Government  predicated  upon \\n\\n \\nA  person  who  seeks  access  to  classified  information  enters  into  a  fiduciary \\nrelationship  with \\ntrust  and  confidence.  This \\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \\nGovernment  reposes  a  high  degree  of  trust  and  confidence  in  individuals  to  whom  it \\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \\nthe  possible  risk  the  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  protect  or \\nsafeguard  classified  information.  Such  decisions  entail  a  certain  degree  of  legally \\n\\n \\n3 \\n \\n \\n\\n\f",
       "permissible  extrapolation  as  to  potential,  rather  than  actual,  risk  of  compromise  of \\nclassified information. \\n\\n  \\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of \\nthe  national  interest  and  shall  in  no  sense  be  a  determination  as  to  the  loyalty  of  the \\napplicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \\n \\n\\n \\n\\nAnalysis \\n\\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \\n\\nout in AG &amp; 18:       \\n \\n\\nFailure  or  inability  to  live  within  one=s  means,  satisfy  debts,  and  meet \\nfinancial  obligations  may  indicate  poor  self-control,  lack  of  judgment,  or \\nunwillingness  to  abide  by  rules  and  regulations,  all  of  which  can  raise \\nquestions  about  an  individual=s  reliability,  trustworthiness  and  ability  to \\nprotect  classified \\nfinancially \\noverextended  is  at  risk  of  having  to  engage  in  illegal  acts  to  generate \\nfunds.  \\n\\ninformation.  An \\n\\nindividual  who \\n\\nis \\n\\n \\n\\nThe  guideline  notes  several  disqualifying  conditions  that  could  raise  security \\nconcerns. I find AG &amp;19(a) (an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); and AG &amp;19(c) \\n(a  history  of  not  meeting  financial  obligations)  apply  to  Applicant’s  case.  Applicant \\nencountered  financial  problems  since  2008,  which  resulted  in  a  bankruptcy  filing  in \\n2010.   \\n \\nAn  individual  who  is  financially  irresponsible  may  also  be  irresponsible, \\nunconcerned, or careless in their obligations to protect classified information. Behaving \\nirresponsibly in one aspect of life provides an indication of how a person may behave in \\nother  aspects  of  life.  A  person’s  relationship  with  his  creditors  is  a  private  matter  until \\nevidence  is  uncovered  demonstrating  an  inability  or  unwillingness  to  pay  debts  under \\nagreed  terms.  Absent  evidence  of  strong  extenuating  or  mitigating  circumstances,  an \\napplicant with a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk \\ninconsistent with the holding of a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be \\ndebt free, but is required to manage his finances in such a way as to meet his financial \\nobligations.  \\n\\n \\nThe  Government’s  substantial  evidence  and  Applicant’s  own  admissions  raise \\nsecurity  concerns  under  Guideline  F.  The  burden  shifted  to  Applicant  to  produce \\nevidence  to  rebut,  explain,  extenuate,  or  mitigate  the  security  concerns.  (Directive \\n¶E3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden \\nof  disproving  it  never  shifts  to  the  Government.  (See  ISCR  Case  No.  02-31154  at  5 \\n(App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005))  \\n\\n \\n4 \\n \\n \\n\\n\f",
       "The  guideline  also  includes  examples  of  conditions  that  could  mitigate  security \\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions potentially \\napply:  \\n \\nAG  &amp;  20(a)  (the  behavior  happened  so  long  ago,  was  so  infrequent,  or \\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \\ncast  doubt  on  the  individual’s  current  reliability,  trustworthiness,  or  good \\njudgment);  \\n \\nAG  &amp;  20(b)  (the  conditions  that  resulted  in  the  financial  problem  were \\nlargely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \\ndownturn,  unexpected  medical  emergency,  or  a  death,  divorce  or \\nseparation),  and \\nthe \\ncircumstances);  \\n \\nAG  ¶  20(c)  (the  person  has  received  or  is  receiving  counseling  for  the \\nproblem  and/or  there  are  clear  indications  that  the  problem  is  being \\nresolved or is under control);  \\n\\nresponsibly  under \\n\\nthe \\n\\nindividual  acted \\n\\n  \\n\\nAG  &amp;  20(d)  (the  individual  initiated  a  good-faith  effort  to  repay  overdue \\ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts); and   \\n\\n \\n\\nAG &amp;20(e) (the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \\nof  the  past-due  debt  which  is  the  cause  of  the  problem  and  provides \\ndocumented  proof  to  substantiate  the  basis  of  the  dispute  or  provides \\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue). \\n \\nApplicant’s  financial  problems  were  caused  by  a  business  downturn  and \\nexpenses  related  to  his  divorce  from  his  second  wife  in  2009.  His  business  partners \\nbroke their agreements with Applicant during the real estate downturn, leaving Applicant \\nwith thousands of unpaid bills. He attempted to resolve the situation on his own until he \\ndetermined  he  had  no  option  other  than  bankruptcy.  He  successfully  completed  his \\npayment plan under Chapter 13 and his debts were discharged in September 2015. His \\nsalary  has  increased  an  additional  $8  per  hour  and  he  is  able  to  pay  his  bills.  His \\nfinancial  problems  are  unlikely  to  recur  and  no  longer  cast  doubt  on  his  reliability, \\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. AG ¶¶ 20(a) and 20(b) apply.  \\n\\n \\nAG &amp; 20(c) applies. Applicant was required to attend financial counseling as part \\nof  his  bankruptcy.    He  completed  financial  counseling  as  well  as  the  terms  of  his \\nChapter 13 repayment plan. Applicant’s financial situation is now under control.  \\n\\n \\nAG &amp; 20(d) applies because Applicant demonstrated he made a good-faith effort \\ntowards  resolving  his  delinquent  accounts.    He  completed  his  Chapter  13  repayment \\nplan.  All  payments  were  made  on  a  timely  basis.    AG  &amp;  20(e)  is  applicable  because \\nApplicant disputed the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b, claiming they were part of \\n\\n \\n5 \\n \\n \\n\\n\f",
       "his  bankruptcy.  The  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.b  was  verified  to  be  a  part  of  his \\nbankruptcy. The mortgage debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a is no longer on his credit report.  \\n\\n \\nApplicant  resolved  any  doubts  raised  by  his  financial  situation.  He  successfully  \\n\\ndemonstrated that his financial situation is under control.  \\n \\nWhole-Person Concept \\n \\n \\nUnder  the  whole-person  concept,  the  administrative  judge  must  evaluate  an \\napplicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s \\nconduct  and  all  the  circumstances.  The  administrative  judge  should  consider  the  nine \\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  \\n \\n\\nthe  conduct, \\n\\nis  voluntary;  (6) \\n\\nthe  nature,  extent,  and  seriousness  of \\nto \\n\\nthe  conduct;  (2) \\nthe \\n(1) \\ninclude  knowledgeable \\ncircumstances  surrounding \\nparticipation;  (3)  the  frequency  and  recency  of  the  conduct;  (4)  the \\nindividual’s  age  and maturity  at  the  time  of the  conduct;  (5)  the  extent to \\nwhich  participation \\nthe  presence  or  absence  of \\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \\nfor  the  conduct;  (8)  the  potential  for  pressure,  coercion,  exploitation,  or \\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \\n \\n \\nUnder  AG  ¶  2(c),  the  ultimate  determination  of  whether  to  grant  eligibility  for  a \\nsecurity  clearance  must  be  an  overall  commonsense  judgment  based  upon  careful \\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \\n        \\n\\nI  considered  the  potentially  disqualifying  and  mitigating  conditions  in  light  of  all \\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered several circumstances \\nbeyond  Applicant’s  control  adversely  affected  his  finances,  including  divorce  and  the \\nreal estate downturn that adversely affected his construction business. He successfully \\ncompleted  his  Chapter  13  repayment  plan  and  his  financial  situation  has  stabilized. \\nApplicant mitigated the security concerns raised under financial considerations.  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \\n\\n \\n\\nFormal Findings \\n\\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \\n\\nSubparagraphs 1.a – 1.c:   \\n\\nFor Applicant \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nFOR APPLICANT \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n6 \\n \\n \\n\\n\f",

He has a history of \\nfinancial  delinquencies,  including  delinquent  debts  owed  to  eight  creditors  in  the \\napproximate  amount  of  $37,847.  While  Applicant  has  either  resolved  or  is  making \\npayments  on  five  of  his  debts,  he  failed  to  establish  that  three  others  are  being \\naddressed. Applicant has  not mitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns \\nbecause he has failed to show he  acted responsibly with respect to  these outstanding \\ndebts. He mitigated the Foreign Influence security concerns created by his mother, two \\nsisters, and three brothers, who are all citizens and residents of Vietnam. Eligibility for \\naccess to classified information is denied.  \\n \\n\\nStatement of the Case \\n\\n \\n\\nOn  December  5,  2014,  the  Defense  Office  of  Hearings  and  Appeals  (DOHA) \\nissued  a  Statement  of  Reasons  (SOR)  to  Applicant  detailing  security  concerns  under \\nGuideline  F,  Financial  Considerations  and  Guideline  B,  Foreign  Influence.  The  action \\nwas  taken  under  Executive  Order  (EO)  10865,  Safeguarding  Classified  Information \\nwithin  Industry  (February  20,  1960),  as  amended;  Department  of  Defense  Directive \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n1 \\n\\n\f",

(Item 1.) \\n\\n \\nApplicant responded to the SOR (Answer) on January 11, 2015 and February 2, \\n \\n2015. (Item 1.) He requested that his case be decided by an administrative judge on the \\nwritten  record.  Department  Counsel  submitted  the  Government’s  written  case  on  April \\n21,  2016.  A  complete  copy  of  the  File  of  Relevant  Material  (FORM),  containing  five \\nItems, was received by Applicant on April 27, 2016. He was afforded an opportunity to \\nfile objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation within 30 days \\nof  his  receipt of  the  FORM.  Applicant  submitted documents  marked  Applicant  Exhibits \\n(AE) A through K in response to the FORM within the 30-day period that ended May 27, \\n2016.  Department  Counsel  had  no  objection  to  AE  A  through  AE  K,  and  they  are \\nadmitted into the record. DOHA assigned the case to me on December 13, 2016.  \\n \\n\\nProcedural Rulings \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nIn  the  FORM,  the  Government  requested  I  take  administrative  notice  of  certain \\nfacts  relating  to  Vietnam.  Department  Counsel  provided  a  five-page  summary  of  the \\nfacts,  supported  by  five  Government  documents  pertaining  to  Vietnam,  identified  as \\nItem  6.  The  documents  provide  elaboration  and  context  for  the  summary.  I  take \\nadministrative  notice  of  the  facts  included  in  the  U.S.  Government  reports.  They  are \\nlimited to matters of general knowledge, not subject to reasonable dispute. They are set \\nout in the Findings of Fact. \\n\\n \\n\\nFindings of Fact \\n\\n \\n \\nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations in subparagraphs 2.a and 2.b. He failed \\nto explicitly admit or deny SOR subparagraph 1.a through 1.h, and as a result, they will \\nbe treated as denials. (Item 1.) After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, and \\nexhibits, I make the following findings of fact. \\n \\n \\nApplicant is 51 years old. He was born in Vietnam and immigrated to the United \\nStates. He attended a U.S. high school. He became a U.S. citizen in 1981.  He earned \\nan  associate’s  degree  in  1984  from  a  U.S.  college.  He  was  employed  by  a  federal \\ncontractor from February 2011 until he was laid off in February 2013. He is married to a \\nU.S. citizen, and has two children who are U. S. citizens. (Item 2.) \\n \\n \\napproximate amount of $37,847. His debts are as follows. \\n \\n \\nApplicant  is  delinquent  on  his  $257,199  primary  mortgage  in  the  amount  of \\n$10,420,  as  alleged  in  SOR  subparagraph  1.a.  He  presented  documentation  showing \\nhe made payments of $2,085 to this creditor on December 26, 2014, January 20, 2015, \\nand  May  14,  2016.  He  indicated  in  a  letter  that  he  was  trying  to  bring  this  account \\ncurrent. However, he failed to establish a regular payment history and document that he \\nbrought this debt current. It remains unresolved. (Item 1; AE A; AE B.) \\n\\nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleges Applicant is indebted to eight creditors in the \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n2 \\n\\n\f",
       "Applicant  was  delinquent  on  a  $17,986  second  mortgage  in  the  amount  of \\n \\n$2,295, as  alleged  in SOR  subparagraph 1.b.  He  presented a  letter  from this  creditor, \\ndated March 15, 2015, which reflected this debt was paid in full on March 11, 2016. It is \\nresolved. (Item 1; AE C.) \\n \\n \\nApplicant was indebted on a charged-off credit card in the amount of $20,632, as \\nalleged in SOR subparagraph 1.c. He presented a letter from this creditor, dated March \\n9, 2013, which reflected this debt was paid in full. It is resolved. (Item 1; AE D.) \\n \\n \\nApplicant was delinquent on an $11,935  vehicle loan in the amount of $618, as \\nalleged in SOR subparagraph 1.d. Applicant presented a copy of a receipt for a check in \\nthe  amount  of  $710,  dated  April  29,  2016,  and  an  account  statement  that  shows \\nApplicant’s loan was current as of March 30, 2016, with an unpaid balance of $7,422.50 \\nremaining on the loan. Applicant is current on this debt. (Item 1; AE E; AE F.)  \\n \\n \\nApplicant  is  indebted  on  a  charged-off  account  in  the  amount  of  $2,654,  as \\nalleged in SOR subparagraph 1.e. He produced a written payment agreement with this \\ncreditor,  which  shows  he  agreed  to  make  monthly  payments  of  $100.  He  produced \\ndocumentation that shows he made one $100 payment on May 14, 2016.  This debt is \\nbeing resolved. (AE H.) \\n \\n \\nApplicant is indebted on a charged-off account in the amount of $530, as alleged \\nin SOR subparagraph 1.f. Applicant produced no documentation that corresponds with \\nthis account. It is unresolved. (Item 5.) \\n \\nApplicant is indebted on a charged-off account in the amount of $409, as alleged \\n \\nin  SOR  subparagraph  1.g.  Applicant  produced  a  letter  from  a  collection  agent  on  this \\naccount, which offered to settle this debt for a payment of $229.06. He failed to produce \\ndocumentation  to  show  he  made  any  payments  to  the  creditor  under  this  agreement. \\n(AE K.)  \\n \\n \\nApplicant  was  indebted  on  a  charged-off  account  in  the  amount  of  $289,  as \\nalleged  in  SOR  subparagraph  1.h.  Applicant  presented  a  receipt  dated  May  20,  2016, \\nwhich shows Applicant paid this debt. It is resolved. (AE J.) \\n \\n \\nApplicant  attributed  his  delinquencies  to  a  reduction  of  hours  at  his  previous \\nemployer, his wife’s unemployment, and his current unemployment. He also noted that \\nhe was aiding his daughter with her university expenses. (AE A.) Applicant provided no \\nrecent household budget showing monthly household expenses, although an April 2013 \\npersonal financial statement showed his expenses exceeded his income by more than \\n$1,000 per month. (Item 3.) He did not provide a copy of his current earnings statement. \\nWithout updated information, I am unable to assess his current financial status, and his \\nability  or  willingness  to  repay  his  remaining  delinquent  debt  and  avoid  future \\ndelinquencies. The record lacks any evidence of credit or financial counseling.  \\n \\n \\nUnder  Guideline  B,  the  SOR  alleges  Applicant’s  mother,  two  sisters,  and  three \\nbrothers  are  citizens  and  residents  of  Vietnam.  Applicant’s  mother  is  unemployed.  He \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n3 \\n\\n\f",
       "communicates  with  her  on  a  monthly  basis  by  phone  and  sees  her  yearly,  when  she \\nvisits  the  United  States.  One  of  Applicant’s  sisters  is  a  waitress,  and  the  other  is  a \\nconstruction  helper.  Applicant’s  brothers  are  unemployed.  Applicant  has  not  seen  his \\nsiblings  in  person  since  1997.  He  communicates  with  them  approximately  once  per \\nmonth.  None  of  his  relatives  in  Vietnam  is  employed  by  the  Vietnamese  government. \\nHis family members in Vietnam are not aware he has applied for a security clearance. \\n(Item 3.)  \\n \\n \\nVietnam is an authoritarian state ruled by the Communist Party of Vietnam. The \\nVietnamese Government arbitrarily arrests and detains individuals for political activities. \\nThe  Government  limits  freedom  of  speech,  religion,  and  the  press.  U.S.  citizens  have \\nbeen detained after traveling in the area of closed borders with China, Cambodia, and \\nLaos.  By  Vietnamese  law,  anyone  born  to  at  least  one  Vietnamese-citizen  parent  is \\nconsidered to be a Vietnamese citizen. (Item 6.) \\n \\n\\nPolicies \\n\\n \\n\\nWhen  evaluating  an  applicant’s  suitability \\n\\n \\nthe \\nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \\nintroductory  explanations  for  each  guideline,  the  adjudicative  guidelines  list  potentially \\ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \\napplicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. \\n \\n\\nfor  a  security  clearance, \\n\\nThese  guidelines  are  not  inflexible  rules  of  law.  Instead,  recognizing  the \\ncomplexities  of  human  behavior,  administrative  judges  apply  the  guidelines  in \\nconjunction with the factors listed in AG ¶ 2(a), describing the adjudicative process. The \\nadministrative \\nimpartial,  and \\ncommonsense  decision.  According  to  AG  ¶ 2(c),  the  entire  process  is  a  conscientious \\nscrutiny  of  a  number  of  variables  known  as  the  “whole-person  concept.”  The \\nadministrative  judge  must  consider  all  available,  reliable  information  about  the  person, \\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \\n\\njudge’s  overarching  adjudicative  goal \\n\\nis  a \\n\\nfair, \\n\\n \\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) \\nrequires  that  “[a]ny  doubt  concerning  personnel  being  considered  for  access  to \\nclassified  information  will  be  resolved  in  favor  of  national  security.”  In  reaching  this \\ndecision,  I  have  drawn  only  those  conclusions  that  are  reasonable,  logical,  and  based \\non the evidence contained in the record.  \\n\\n \\nUnder  Directive  ¶  E3.1.14,  the  Government  must  present  evidence  to  establish \\ncontroverted  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  Under  Directive  ¶  E3.1.15,  the  applicant  is \\nresponsible  for  presenting  “witnesses  and  other  evidence  to  rebut,  explain,  extenuate, \\nor  mitigate  facts  admitted  by  the  applicant  or  proven  by  Department  Counsel.”  The \\napplicant  has  the  ultimate  burden  of  persuasion  to  obtain  a  favorable  clearance \\ndecision.  \\n\\n \\nA  person  who  seeks  access  to  classified  information  enters  into  a  fiduciary \\ntrust  and  confidence.  This \\n\\nthe  Government  predicated  upon \\n\\n \\nrelationship  with \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n4 \\n\\n\f",
       "relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \\nGovernment  reposes  a  high  degree  of  trust  and  confidence  in  individuals  to  whom  it \\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \\nthe  possible  risk  the  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  protect  or \\nsafeguard  classified  information.  Such  decisions  entail  a  certain  degree  of  legally \\npermissible  extrapolation  as  to  potential,  rather  than  actual,  risk  of  compromise  of \\nclassified information. \\n \\n\\nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be “in terms of the \\nnational  interest  and  shall  in  no  sense  be  a  determination  as  to  the  loyalty  of  the \\napplicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \\n \\n\\nAnalysis \\n\\nThe  security  concern  for  Financial  Considerations  is  set  out  in  AG  ¶  18,  as \\n\\nfollows:       \\n \\n\\nFailure  or  inability  to  live  within  one’s  means,  satisfy  debts,  and  meet \\nfinancial  obligations  may  indicate  poor  self-control,  lack  of  judgment,  or \\nunwillingness  to  abide  by  rules  and  regulations,  all  of  which  can  raise \\nquestions  about  an  individual’s  reliability,  trustworthiness  and  ability  to \\nprotect  classified \\nfinancially \\noverextended  is  at  risk  of  having  to  engage  in  illegal  acts  to  generate \\nfunds.  \\n \\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise a security concern under \\n\\ninformation.  An \\n\\nindividual  who \\n\\nis \\n\\nAG ¶ 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \\n \\n\\n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \\n \\n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \\n\\n \\n \\nApplicant  had  a  history  of  financial  delinquencies  that  he  had  been  unable  to \\nresolve,  including  delinquent  debts  to  eight  creditors  in  the  approximate  amount  of \\n$37,847,  as  alleged  in  the  SOR.  The  Government  established  the  disqualifying \\nconditions in AG ¶ 19(a) and 19(c). Further inquiry about the applicability of mitigating \\nconditions is required.  \\n \\n \\napplicable:  \\n\\nFive Financial Considerations mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially \\n\\n \\n(a)  the  behavior  happened  so  long  ago,  was  so  infrequent,  or  occurred \\nunder  such  circumstances  that  it  is  unlikely  to  recur  and  does  not  cast \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n5 \\n\\n\f",

His debt is current and on-going as demonstrated by the \\nunresolved debts in SOR subparagraphs 1.a, 1.f, and 1.g. Applicant’s conduct does not \\nwarrant application of AG ¶ 20(a).  \\n \\nApplicant’s debts, which were identified in the SOR, may have been due, in part, \\n \\nto his unemployment and underemployment and his wife’s unemployment. However, he \\nalso  made  the  decision  to  pay  for  his  daughter’s  university  education,  instead  of  his \\nprimary  mortgage  and  other  debts.  Further,  he  failed  to  demonstrate  responsible \\nbehavior  toward  those  accounts  that  remain  unresolved.  AG  ¶  20(b)  is  only  partially \\nmitigating. \\n \\n \\nApplicant  provided  no  evidence  of  the  depth  or  duration  of  any  financial \\ncounseling.  There  are  no  clear  indications  that  his  delinquent  debts  in  subparagraphs \\n1.a,  1.f,  and  1.g  are  being  resolved  or  are  under  control.  Mitigation  under  AG  ¶  20(c) \\nhas not been established. \\n \\n \\nApplicant  resolved  the  debts  in  subparagraphs  1.b,  1.c,  and  1.h,  and  is  making \\npayments  toward  the  resolution  of  the  debts  in  subparagraphs  1.d  and  1.e.  Mitigation \\nunder AG ¶ 20(d) applies in part to the debts identified in subparagraphs 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, \\n1.e, and 1.h. \\n \\n \\nAG  ¶  20(e)  requires  Applicant  to  provide  documented  proof  to  substantiate  the \\nbasis of any dispute or provide evidence of actions to resolve the issue.

Adjudication  under  this  Guideline  can  and  should \\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \\nfinancial \\nto,  such \\nconsiderations  as  whether  the  foreign  country  is  known  to  target  United \\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \\nrisk of terrorism. \\n\\nincluding,  but  not \\n\\ninterest \\n\\nis \\n\\nlocated, \\n\\nlimited \\n\\n \\n\\nThe  guideline  notes  several  conditions  that could  raise  security  concerns  under \\n\\nAG ¶ 7. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \\n\\n \\n(a)  contact  with  a  foreign  family  member,  business  or  professional \\nassociate,  friend,  or  other  person  who  is  a  citizen  of  or  resident  in  a \\nforeign  country  if  that  contact  creates  a  heightened  risk  of  foreign \\nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \\n \\n(b)  connections  to  a  foreign  person,  group,  government,  or  country  that \\ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual’s obligation to \\nprotect  sensitive  information  or  technology  and  the  individual’s  desire  to \\nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information. \\n \\nApplicant’s  mother  and  five  siblings  are  Vietnamese  citizens  and  reside  in  the \\n  \\nVietnam. Due to his ties to his family, and the threats present in Vietnam as set out in \\nItem  6,  a  heightened  risk  of  foreign  exploitation,  inducement,  manipulation,  pressure, \\nand  coercion  is  present.  The  evidence  is  sufficient  to  raise  the  above  disqualifying \\nconditions. \\n \\n \\nof the mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 8 including: \\n \\n\\nAG ¶ 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \\n\\n(a) the nature of the relationship with foreign persons, the country in which \\nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \\nthat  country  are  such  that  it  is  unlikely  the  individual  will  be  placed  in  a \\nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \\ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.;  \\n \\n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual’s sense of \\nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \\nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n7 \\n\\n\f",
       "and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \\nconflict of interests in favor of the U.S. interests; and \\n \\n(c)  contact  or  communication  with  foreign  citizens  is  so  casual  and \\ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \\ninfluence or exploitation. \\n \\nApplicant  maintains  relationships  with  his  mother  and  siblings,  who  are  citizens \\nand residents of Vietnam. His contact with his mother is the most frequent. The Appeal \\nBoard has held that there is a rebuttable presumption that ties with immediate family are \\nnot  casual.1  The  evidence  shows  that  Applicant  maintains  his  relationship  with  his \\nmother  during  the  year  through  phone  calls  and  her  annual  visits.  He  also  maintains \\nregular contact with his siblings, although that contact is not as frequent as it is with his \\nmother. While none of Applicant’s foreign family members are aware of his request for a \\nsecurity  clearance,  given  these  facts  and  Applicant's  close  ties  to  his  foreign  family \\nmembers, I cannot confidently conclude that Applicant could not be placed in a position \\nof having to choose between the interests of foreign individuals and the interests of the \\nUnited States. AG ¶ 8 (a) and (c) do not apply. \\n\\n \\n Applicant  has  established  deep  and  longstanding  relationships  in  the  United \\nStates. He spent a formative part of his youth in the U.S and attended college here. He \\nchose  to  stay  in  the  United  States  after  finishing  his  education.  He  became  a  U.S. \\ncitizen.  He  is  married  to  an  American  citizen.  His  children  are  U.S.  citizens.  Applicant \\ncan  be expected  to  resolve  any  conflict  of  interest  in favor  of  the  United  States.  AG  ¶ \\n8(b) is mitigating. \\n \\nWhole-Person Concept \\n \\n \\nUnder  the  whole-person  concept,  the  administrative  judge  must  evaluate  an \\napplicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s \\nconduct  and  all  relevant  circumstances.  The  administrative  judge  should  consider  the \\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  \\n \\n\\nthe  nature,  extent,  and  seriousness  of \\nto \\n\\nthe  conduct;  (2) \\nthe \\n(1) \\ncircumstances  surrounding \\ninclude  knowledgeable \\nparticipation;  (3)  the  frequency  and  recency  of  the  conduct;  (4)  the \\nindividual’s  age  and maturity  at  the  time  of the  conduct;  (5)  the  extent to \\nwhich  participation \\nthe  presence  or  absence  of \\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \\nfor  the  conduct;  (8)  the  potential  for  pressure,  coercion,  exploitation,  or \\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \\n\\nthe  conduct, \\n\\nis  voluntary;  (6) \\n\\n \\nUnder AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant  eligibility for a security \\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \\nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \\n\\n                                                           \\n1 ISCR Case No. 00-0484 at 4-5 (App. Bd.

       " \\n\\nI  considered  the  potentially  disqualifying  and  mitigating  conditions  in  light  of  all \\nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \\nGuidelines F and B in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were \\naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. The Foreign \\nInfluence  concerns  related  to  Applicant’s  mother  and  siblings,  who  are  citizens  and \\nresidents  in Vietnam, are mitigated. However,  Applicant has not acted in a trustworthy \\nmanner  when  it  comes  to  addressing  his  financial  delinquencies.  There  is  insufficient \\nevidence  to  demonstrate  that  recurrence  of  financial  irresponsibility  is  unlikely.  The \\npotential for pressure, coercion, or duress remains undiminished. \\n\\n \\nOverall,  the  record  evidence  leaves  me  with  questions  and  doubts  as  to \\nApplicant’s  eligibility  and  suitability  for  a  security  clearance.

       "The Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On\\nAugust 19, 2015, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\\ndecision–security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of\\nDefense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a decision\\non the written record.  On June 27, 2016, after considering the record, Defense Office of Hearings\\nand Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Martin H. Mogul denied Applicant’s request for a\\nsecurity clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive ¶¶ E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\\n\\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in making findings\\nof fact and whether the Judge’s decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent\\nwith the following, we affirm.\\n\\nThe Judge’s Findings of Fact  \\n\\nApplicant is 46 years old, married, and has four children.  He earned a bachelor’s degree in\\n1994.    Since  2010,  he  has  been  employed  by  a  defense  contractor.    In  his  security  clearance\\napplication, he explained that he encountered difficultly paying bills in 2008 after being laid off\\nfrom a second job due to the company’s bankruptcy.  He gave no explanation for why he did not\\nbegin attempting to resolve the debts until the issuance of the SOR.\\n\\nApplicant admitted each of the five delinquent debts alleged in the SOR.  For the debt in\\nSOR  ¶  1.a  for  about  $500,  Applicant  wrote  in  his  Response  to  Department  Counsel’s  File  of\\nRelevant Material (FORM) that the debt was paid off.  The creditor agreed to accept three monthly\\npayments of about $100 to settle the debt.  A document showed the creditor made arrangements with\\nApplicant to debit electronically about $100 from his account in September 2015 for this debt.  For\\nthe 2009 judgment in SOR ¶ 1.b for about $14,000, Applicant indicated that, at the time he answered\\nthe SOR, he was unable to negotiate a settlement.  In his Response to the FORM, he provided\\ndocuments showing his wages were being garnished biweekly for the next six months for this debt\\nand about $350 was garnished from his pay at the end of November 2015.  No evidence was\\npresented to establish the total amount deducted from his pay or how much is still owed on that debt. \\nFor the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 1.b, and 1.c for about $2,500, $5,600, and $3600, Applicant wrote in\\nhis Response to the FORM that he is currently on a schedule to repay between $150 and $190 a\\nmonth on each debt until it is resolved.  He provided proof of payments toward those debts from\\nSeptember through November 2015.\\n\\nThe Judge’s Analysis\\n\\nThe  Judge  found  Applicant  did  not  act  responsibly  because,  even  though  he  has  been\\nemployed by his current employer since 2010, he only began making payments towards the debts\\nafter the SOR was issued.  The Judge also concluded that, while the mitigation condition concerning\\nthe initiation of a good-faith effort to repay the creditors was applicable, it was not controlling\\nbecause Applicant must establish a consistent history of continuing to resolve his debts. \\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\n2\\n\\n\f",
       "In the appeal brief, Applicant provided character reference letters and documents showing\\npayments  on,  or  settlement  of,  various  debts.    Most  of  those  documents,  however,  were  not\\npreviously submitted to the Judge and constitute new evidence that the Appeal Board is prohibited\\nfrom receiving or considering.  Directive ¶ E3.1.29.  \\n\\nApplicant claims the Judge erred in the findings of fact.  For example, he states that he has\\nsix children (instead of four) and started working for his current employer in 2012 (instead of 2010). \\nIn  his  security  clearance  application,  however,  Applicant  listed  that  he  had  four  children  and\\nindicated he started working for his employer in 2010.  He failed to establish that the Judge erred\\nin the findings of fact.  Our review reveals the Judge’s material findings are based upon substantial\\nevidence or constitute reasonable inferences or conclusions that could be drawn from the record\\nevidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-03420 at 3 (App. Bd. July 25, 2014).  Applicant also argues\\nthat he mitigated the security concerns arising from his debts.  His arguments are not sufficient to\\nshow that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to\\nlaw.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-06634 at 2 (App. Bd. Apr. 28, 2016).   \\n   \\n\\nThe Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the\\ndecision.  The decision is sustainable on this record.  “The general standard is that a clearance may\\nbe granted only when ‘clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.’” Department\\nof the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  See also Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b):  “Any doubt\\nconcerning personnel being considered for access to classified information will be resolved in favor\\nof the national security.”\\n\\nThe Decision is AFFIRMED.  \\n\\nOrder\\n\\nSigned: Michael Ra’anan        \\nMichael Ra’anan\\nAdministrative Judge\\nChairperson, Appeal Board\\n\\nSigned: James E.

The  action  was  taken  under  Executive  Order  10865,  Safeguarding  Classified\\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\\nDirective  5220.6,  Defense  Industrial  Personnel  Security  Clearance  Review  Program\\n(January  2,  1992),  as  amended  (Directive);  and  the  adjudicative  guidelines  (AG)\\neffective within the Department of Defense after September 1, 2006. \\n\\n \\nOn September 12, 2015, Applicant replied to the SOR (RSOR) in writing, and he\\nrequested that his case be decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. (Item 1.)\\nOn  October  27,  2015,  Department  Counsel  issued  the  Department's  written  case.  A\\ncomplete  copy  of  the  file  of  relevant  material  (FORM)  was  provided  to  Applicant  on\\nNovember  4,  2015.  In  the  FORM,  Department  Counsel  offered  six  documentary\\nexhibits. (Items 1-6.) Applicant was given the opportunity to file objections and submit\\nmaterial in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. A response was due by December 10,\\n2015.

The  allegations  will  be\\ndiscussed below in the same order as they were listed on the SOR:\\n\\n1.a. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR for a collection account in the amount\\nof $518.  In his RSOR, Applicant admitted this SOR allegation. In his Post-FORM letter,\\nApplicant wrote that this debt had been paid off. Applicant also included a letter from the\\ncreditor indicating that they would accept three monthly payments of $104.48 to settle\\nthis debt. (Item A.) Item E shows that the creditor made an arrangement with Applicant\\nto debit electronically $104.48 from Applicant’s account on September 11, 2015, for this\\ndebt.\\n\\n1.b. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR for a judgement filed against Applicant\\nin  April  2009,  in  the  amount  of  $14,892.    In  his  RSOR,  Applicant  admitted  this  SOR\\nallegation,  and  he  wrote  that  he  was  unable  to  negotiate  at  this  time.  (Item  1.)  In  his\\nPost-FORM letter, Applicant wrote that this judgment debt had been placed with a law\\nfirm that informed Applicant a portion of his wages would be garnished bi-weekly for the\\nnext  six  months.  (Item  A.)  Items  F  and  G  show  that  $357.73  was  deducted  from  the\\npaycheck of Applicant on November 29, 2015.  No evidence was introduced to establish\\nthe total amount that has been deducted from Applicant’s pay or how much is still owing\\non this debt. \\n\\n1.c. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR for a collection account in the amount\\nof $2,506. In his RSOR, Applicant admitted this SOR allegation. (Item 1.) In his Post-\\nFORM letter, Applicant wrote that he is currently on a payment schedule for this debt to\\npay $156.25 a month until this debt is resolved. (Item A.) Item E shows that Applicant\\nhas  made  one  payment  of  $163.75  on  September  14,  2015,  and  two  payments  of\\n$156.25 on October 14, 2015, and November 17, 2015, toward this debt.\\n\\n1.d. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR for a collection account in the amount\\nof $5,649. In his RSOR, Applicant admitted this SOR allegation. (Item 1.) In his Post-\\n\\n2\\n\\n\f",
       "FORM letter, Applicant wrote that he is currently on a payment schedule for this debt to\\npay $187.90 a month until this debt is resolved. (Item A.) Item D shows that Applicant\\nhas made three payments of $187.90 on September 28, 2015; October 26, 2015; and\\nNovember 23, 2015; and three additional payments of $104.48.\\n\\n1.e. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR for a collection account in the amount\\nof $3,677.  In his RSOR, Applicant admitted this SOR allegation. (Item 1.) In his Post-\\nFORM letter, Applicant wrote that he is currently on a payment schedule for this debt to\\npay $155 a month until this debt is resolved. (Item A.) Item C shows that Applicant has\\nmade two payments of $155 on October 26, 2015, and November 23, 2015, toward this\\ndebt.\\n\\nApplicant  completed  an  Electronic  Questionnaires  for  Investigations  Processing\\n(e-QIP) on July 26, 2011, and he explained each of his delinquent debts, writing, “In Year\\n2008, had difficulty paying bills due to being laid off at 2  job due to company file [sic]\\nbankruptcy.”  (Item  2.)  As  reviewed  above,  Applicant  began  working  at  his present\\nemployment in 2010, but he gave no explanation for why he did not begin attempting to\\nresolve his debts until  2015, after the SOR was issued. \\n\\nnd\\n\\nPolicies\\n\\nWhen  evaluating  an  applicant’s  suitability \\n\\nthe\\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\\nto  brief  introductory  explanations  for  each  guideline,  the  adjudicative  guidelines  list\\npotentially  disqualifying  conditions  and  mitigating  conditions,  which  are  useful  in\\nevaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information.\\n\\nfor  a  security  clearance, \\n\\nThese  guidelines  are  not  inflexible  rules  of  law.  Instead,  recognizing  the\\ncomplexities  of  human  behavior,  these  guidelines  are  applied  in  conjunction  with  the\\nfactors  listed  in  the  adjudicative  process.  The  administrative  judge’s  over-arching\\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 2(c),\\nthe  entire  process  is  a  conscientious  scrutiny  of  a  number  of  variables  known  as  the\\n“whole-person  concept.”  The  administrative  judge  must  consider  all  available,  reliable\\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\\ndecision.\\n\\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b)\\nrequires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\\ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this decision, I have\\ndrawn  only  those  conclusions  that  are  reasonable,  logical  and  based  on  the  evidence\\ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere\\nspeculation or conjecture.\\n\\nUnder  Directive  ¶  E3.1.14,  the  Government  must  present  evidence  to  establish\\ncontroverted  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  Under  Directive  ¶  E3.1.15,  the  Applicant  is\\nresponsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\\nmitigate  facts  admitted  by  applicant  or  proven  by  Department  Counsel.  .  .  .”  The\\n\\n3\\n\\n\f",
       "Applicant  has  the  ultimate  burden  of  persuasion  as  to  obtaining  a  favorable  security\\ndecision. \\n\\nA  person  who  seeks  access  to  classified  information  enters  into  a  fiduciary\\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government\\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\\nthe  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  protect  or  safeguard  classified\\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as\\nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\\n\\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of\\nthe  national  interest and  shall in no  sense be  a determination  as  to the  loyalty  of  the\\napplicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \\n\\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\\n\\nAnalysis\\n\\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\\n\\nout in AG ¶ 18:  \\n\\n      Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet\\nfinancial  obligations  may  indicate  poor  self-control,  lack  of  judgment,  or\\nunwillingness  to  abide  by  rules  and  regulations,  all  of  which  can  raise\\nquestions  about  an  individual’s  reliability,  trustworthiness  and  ability  to\\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \\n\\nThe  guideline  notes  several  conditions  that  could  raise  security  concerns  and\\ncould potentially apply in this case.  Under AG ¶ 19(a), “an inability or unwillingness to\\nsatisfy  debts,”  is  potentially  disqualifying.  Similarly  under  AG  ¶  19(c),  “a  history  of  not\\nmeeting  financial  obligations,”  may  raise  security  concerns.  I  find  that  both  of  these\\ndisqualifying  conditions  apply  to  Applicant  in  this  case.  The  evidence  has  established\\nthat Applicant accumulated significant delinquent debt several years ago.  \\n\\nAG ¶ 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns from financial\\ndifficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(b), it may be mitigating where, “the conditions that resulted in\\nthe financial problem were largely beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment,\\na  business  downturn,  unexpected  medical  emergency,  or  a  death,  divorce  or\\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.” As reviewed\\nabove,  some  of  Applicant’s  financial  difficulties  occurred  as  a  result  of  his  periods  of\\nunemployment. However, since Applicant has been employed by his current employer\\nsince 2010, and only began making payments toward the SOR debts after the SOR was\\n\\n4\\n\\n\f",
       "issued in 2015, I find that Applicant has not acted responsibly. Accordingly, I find that this\\nmitigating condition is not applicable in this case. \\n\\n¶  20(d)  is  now  applicable  but  not  controlling,  since  Applicant  has  begun  taking\\naction to “initiate a good-faith effort to repay his overdue creditors or otherwise resolve\\ndebts,”  because  even  though  he  has  been  working  at  his  present  employment  since\\n2010,  he  did  not  begin  this  process  until  after  the  SOR  was  issued  in  2015.  To  be\\napplicable and controlling in the future, Applicant must establish a consistent history of\\ncontinuing  to  resolve  these  delinquent  past  debts  and  not  become  past  due  on  his\\npresent debts. At this time, I find Guideline F against Applicant.\\n\\nWhole-Person Concept\\n\\nUnder  the  whole-person  concept,  the  administrative  judge  must  evaluate  an\\napplicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s\\nconduct  and  all  the  circumstances.  The  administrative  judge  should  consider  the  nine\\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a): \\n\\nthe  conduct, \\n\\nto \\n\\n(1)  the  nature,  extent,  and  seriousness  of  the  conduct;  (2)  the\\ncircumstances  surrounding \\ninclude  knowledgeable\\nparticipation;  (3)  the  frequency  and  recency  of  the  conduct;  (4)  the\\nindividual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\\nwhich  participation \\nthe  presence  or  absence  of\\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\\nfor  the  conduct;  (8)  the  potential  for  pressure,  coercion,  exploitation,  or\\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\\n\\nis  voluntary;  (6) \\n\\nUnder AG ¶ 2 (c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\\nsecurity  clearance  must  be  an  overall  commonsense  judgment  based  upon  careful\\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.      \\n\\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the\\nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. Based on all of the reasons cited above\\nas to why the mitigating conditions are not applicable at this time, I find that the record\\nevidence leaves me with significant questions and doubts as to Applicant’s eligibility and\\nsuitability  for  a  security  clearance  under  the  whole-person  concept.  For  all  these\\nreasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns under the whole-\\nperson concept. \\n\\nFormal Findings\\n\\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\\n\\nrequired by ¶ E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\\n\\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\\n\\nAGAINST APPLICANT\\n\\nSubparagraphs 1.a. - 1.e.:\\n\\nAgainst  Applicant\\n\\n5\\n\\n\f",

He  is  a  39-year-old  analyst \\nemployed  by  a  defense  contractor  since  March  2015.  He  worked  for  a  prior  defense \\ncontractor,  at  a  U.S.  Embassy  overseas,  from  January  2008  to  February  2009.  He \\nworked for another defense contractor from August 2010 to November 2012. He was \\ngranted eligibility for a public trust position by another federal agency in 2008. He was \\ngranted a DOD security clearance in 2014.1  \\n\\n \\nApplicant  is  a  native-born  U.S. citizen  and  resident. He  obtained  a  high-school \\ndiploma in the United States in 1996 and a bachelor’s degree from a U.S. university in \\n2001. He was previously married from September 2009 to November 2010. As of the \\nhearing, he was engaged to a native-born U.S. citizen. He does not have any children.2 \\n\\n \\nApplicant enlisted and served as an active duty infantryman in the Israeli military \\nfrom November 2004 to February 2006. Upon completion of his service, he declined an \\noffer to serve in the Israeli military reserves and was honorably discharged. His primary \\nmotivation for serving in the Israeli military was to develop the skills and experience that \\nwould assist him in furthering a career in security in support of the U.S. Government. He \\ninitially desired to serve in the U.S. military, but learned when he spoke to recruiters that \\nhe  was  ineligible  due  to  a  longstanding  medical  condition.  He  explored  alternative \\noptions  to  serve  the  U.S.  Government  through  security  positions  with  defense \\ncontractors  and  in  the  private  sector,  but  discovered  that  all  such  positions  required \\nprior military experience. He did not inquire whether his medical condition would have \\ndisqualified him from holding these positions since he did not meet the requisite criteria \\nof  prior  military  service.  He  did  not  explore  options  that  did  not  require  prior  military \\n\\n                                                           \\n1 Applicant’s response to the SOR; Tr. at 24-25, 70-77; GEs 1-3; AE B.  \\n \\n2 Tr. at 55-125; GE 1. \\n \\n\\n \\n2 \\n \\n\\n\f",
       "experience because such positions would not have provided him with the opportunity to \\ndevelop skills in his desired field.3   \\n\\n \\nApplicant discovered through internet research a program designed for overseas \\nJewish volunteers who had an interest in serving in the Israeli military, so long as one \\nprovided evidence of Jewish heritage. He decided then, at the age of 23, that it was a \\nreasonable option for him to serve in the Israeli military given that the United States and \\nIsrael  were  allies  with  mutual  adversaries.  He  made  this  decision  on  his  own.  He \\ndiscussed  his  decision  with  his  parents,  and  their  conversations  revolved  primarily \\naround their concern for Applicant’s safety.4 \\n\\n \\nIn  2004,  Applicant  traveled  to  Israel  to  join  the  Israeli  military.  Acting  on  the \\nrecommendation  that  he  have  a  basic  proficiency  of  Hebrew  prior  to  enlistment, \\nApplicant  first  engaged  in  a  five-month  language  instruction  program.  The  language \\nprogram  was  not  affiliated  with  the  Israeli  military.  He  subsequently  enlisted  and  the \\nIsraeli military sent him to additional language training.5  \\n\\n \\nDuring the enlistment process, Applicant lied and told the Israeli military that he \\ndid  not  have  the  medical  condition  that  rendered  him  ineligible  to  serve  in  the  U.S. \\nmilitary. He did so because he was told, at an initial enlistment meeting when he arrived \\nin Israel, that his longstanding medical condition, combined with another of his medical \\nconditions, would have lowered his physical profile to such a degree that would have \\ndisqualified  him  from  serving  as  an  infantryman.  He  was  previously  unaware  of  this \\ninformation. He understood from his internet research prior to traveling to Israel that he \\nwould  be  permitted  to  serve  in  some  capacity  despite  his  medical  condition.  He  also \\nunderstood that his medical condition was not necessarily a disqualifier for joining the \\ninfantry.6  \\n\\n \\nApplicant  determined  that  while  he  was  unwilling  to  lie  to  the  U.S.  military  and \\ngovernment about this particular medical condition, it was acceptable for him to lie to \\nthe  Israeli  military  and  government  since  he  did  not  have  any  allegiance  to  them.  He \\nwas not concerned his medical condition would be discovered because he managed it \\nand  was  able  to  maintain  a  high  level  of  fitness.  He  disclosed  his  other  medical \\ncondition  and  medical  history to the  Israeli  military.  In the  13  years that  have  passed \\nsince his enlistment in the Israeli military, Applicant has matured. He understands now \\nthat he should have disclosed his longstanding medical condition to the Israeli military, \\neven if such a disclosure would have prevented him from serving as an infantryman.7   \\n  \\n                                                           \\n3 Tr. at 55-125; GEs 1-3; AEs A, C. \\n \\n4 Tr. at 55-125; GE 3.  \\n \\n5 Tr. at 55-125; GEs 2-3. \\n \\n6 Tr. at 55-125; GE 3. \\n \\n7 Tr. at 55-125; GE 3. \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n3 \\n \\n\\n\f",
       " \\nApplicant’s  ex-girlfriend  resides  in  Israel.  He  met  her  on  an  online  dating  site \\nwhen he attended the five-month language instruction program in Israel. He lived with \\nher while he was serving in the Israeli military. He last communicated with her in 2007. \\nWhen  Applicant  moved  back  to  the  United  States  from  Israel  in  2007,  he  had  social \\nmedia contact with her. He also had social media contact with her one sister who also \\nresides  in  Israel,  and  several  individuals  in  Israel  with  whom  Applicant  served  in  the \\nIsraeli  military,  to  include  his  unit  supervisor.  After  he  received  the  SOR,  Applicant \\ndeleted all of his foreign contacts on social media. He had not previously deleted them \\nbecause  he  consulted  and  was  advised  by  a  former  colleague  that  doing  so  at  once \\nmight trigger to any one of his foreign contacts who might be working in the intelligence \\nfield that he was pursuing a sensitive position. He ultimately decided that since he was \\nnot  in  communication  with  any  of  his  foreign  contacts,  he  did  not  need  to  maintain  a \\nsocial  media  connection  with  them.  Since  he  deleted  his  foreign  contacts  on  social \\nmedia, some have tried to reconnect with him but Applicant has not responded and has \\nno intentions of doing so.8 \\n  \\n \\nApplicant maintains contact with one individual, a U.S. citizen and resident, with \\nwhom Applicant served in the Israeli military.

Since  their  discharge  from  the  Israeli  military, \\nApplicant  and \\nindividual  see  each  other  once  yearly  and  communicate \\napproximately twice yearly.9 \\n \\nAfter  graduating  from  college  and  before  he  served  in  the  Israeli  military, \\n \\nApplicant took a trip to Israel in August 2002 through a birthright program. The program \\nhelped teach him about his Jewish culture. Subsequent to his Israeli military service and \\nduring a period of unemployment, he traveled to Israel in June 2010 through the same \\nbirthright  program.  On  this  occasion,  he  served  as  a  volunteer  male  counselor  to  the \\nprogram.  He  did  not  see  any  of  his  former  Israeli  military  contacts  or  his  ex-girlfriend \\nduring this trip. Both trips were comprised of U.S. citizens, all Jewish Americans, who \\nwanted  to  travel  to  Israel  to  learn  more  about  their  Jewish  culture.  He  has  not  since \\ntraveled  to  Israel.  Should  he  travel  to  Israel  or  any  foreign  country  in  the  future,  he \\nunderstands  as  a  security  clearance  holder  the  requirement  to  report  such  foreign \\ntravel.10 \\n \\n \\nApplicant did not have an Israeli security clearance when he served in the Israeli \\nmilitary.

Strong bilateral relations have fueled and reinforced \\nsignificant  cooperation  between  the  United  States  and  Israel  on  defense-related \\nmatters. Aid for Israel has been designed to maintain Israel’s qualitative military edge \\nover neighboring militaries, since Israel must rely on better equipment and training to \\ncompensate for a manpower deficit in any potential regional conflict. However, U.S. aid \\nto  Israel  is  not  unlimited.  Sales  of  U.S.  defense  articles  and  services  to  Israel  are \\nsubject to the Arms Export Control Act (AECA) and the July 23, 1952, Mutual Defense \\n                                                           \\n11 Tr. at 55-125; GEs 1-3; AE F. \\n \\n12 Tr. at 55-125; GE 1. \\n \\n13 Tr. at 55-125; AEs D-E. \\n\\n \\n5 \\n \\n\\n\f",
       "Assistance Agreement between the United  States and Israel. AECA enumerates the \\npurposes  for  which  foreign  governments  can  use  U.S.  military  articles  and  limits  the \\nability of foreign governments to transfer U.S. military products to third party countries \\nwithout the prior consent of the President of the United States. The 1952 agreement \\nstates  that  the  government  of  Israel  assures  the  United  States  government  that \\nequipment, materials, or services acquired from the United States are required for and \\nwill  be  used  solely  to  maintain  Israel’s  internal  security  and  Israel’s  legitimate  self-\\ndefense.  \\n \\n \\nAlthough the United States has provided regular military support to Israel, there \\nis a significant documented history of classified information and controlled technologies \\nbeing illegally imported to Israel. These include parts used in fighter jets, spy software, \\ncomponents  for  certain  missiles  and  fighter  jet  aircraft,  digital  oscilloscopes  that  are \\ncapable of being utilized in the development of weapons of mass destruction and  in \\nmissile  delivery  fields,  a  product  containing  a  certain  chemical  precursor  that  is \\ncontrolled  for  chemical,  biological,  antiterrorism,  and  chemical  reasons,  pressure \\ntransducers  that  are  controlled  for  nuclear  non-proliferation  reasons,  encryption \\nsoftware  that  is  controlled  for  national  security  reasons,  and  classified  documents. \\nIllegal  technology  transfers,  even  to  private  Israeli  entities,  are  a  significant  concern \\nbecause  foreign  government  entities  have  learned  to  capitalize  on  private-sector \\ntechnology acquisitions.  \\n \\n \\nIn the past 30 years, there have been at least three cases in which employees \\nof the U.S. Government were convicted of disclosing classified information to Israel or \\nof  conspiracy  to  act  as  an  Israeli  agent.  Reports  indicate  that  concerns  regarding \\npossible Israeli espionage persist among U.S. officials. The most prominent espionage \\ncase is that of Jonathan Pollard. He pled guilty in 1986, with his then wife, to selling \\nclassified documents to Israel. Israel granted Pollard, who is serving a life sentence in \\na U.S. federal prison, citizenship in 1996 and, in 1998, acknowledged that Pollard had \\nbeen its agent. \\n \\n \\nA  travel  warning  issued  by  the  U.S.  Department  of  State  for  Israel,  the  West \\nBank, and Gaza remains in effect, as the security environment remains complex due to \\nheightened  tensions  and  security  risks.  U.S.  citizens  are  advised  that  all  persons \\nentering or departing Israel, the West Bank, or Gaza are subject to security screening, \\nand may be denied entry or exit. Israeli security officials have on occasion requested \\naccess  to  travelers’  personal  email  accounts  or  other  social  media  accounts  as  a \\ncondition  of  entry.  In  such  circumstances,  travelers  should  have  no  expectation  of \\nprivacy for any data stored on such devices or in their accounts. \\n  \\n\\n \\n\\nWhen  evaluating  an  applicant’s  suitability \\n\\n \\nthe \\nadministrative  judge  must  consider  the  adjudicative  guidelines.

Instead,  recognizing  the \\ncomplexities  of  human  behavior,  administrative  judges  apply  the  guidelines  in \\nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s \\noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \\nto  AG  ¶  2(a),  the  entire  process  is  a  conscientious  scrutiny  of  a  number  of  variables \\nknown  as  the  “whole-person  concept.”  The  administrative  judge  must  consider  all \\navailable,  reliable  information  about  the  person,  past  and  present,  favorable  and \\nunfavorable, in making a decision. \\n\\n \\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) \\nrequires  that  “[a]ny  doubt  concerning  personnel  being  considered  for  access  to \\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.”  \\n\\n \\nUnder Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \\ncontroverted  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  Under  Directive  ¶  E3.1.15,  the  applicant  is \\nresponsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \\nor  mitigate  facts  admitted  by  the  applicant  or  proven  by  Department  Counsel.”  The \\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \\n\\nthe  Government  predicated  upon \\n\\n \\nA  person  who  seeks  access  to  classified  information  enters  into  a  fiduciary \\n \\nrelationship  with \\ntrust  and  confidence.  This \\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \\nGovernment  reposes  a  high  degree  of  trust  and  confidence  in  individuals  to  whom  it \\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \\nthe  possible  risk  the  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  safeguard \\nclassified  information.  Such  decisions  entail  a  certain  degree  of  legally  permissible \\nextrapolation  of  potential,  rather  than  actual,  risk  of  compromise  of  classified \\ninformation. \\n \\n\\nSection 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be “in terms \\nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \\napplicant  concerned.”  See  also  Exec.  Or.  12968,  Section  3.1(b)  (listing  multiple \\nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \\n\\nAnalysis \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \\n \\n\\nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG ¶ 6:       \\n\\nForeign  contacts  and  interests,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  business, \\nfinancial,  and  property  interests,  are  a  national  security  concern  if  they \\nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \\nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \\nway  inconsistent  with  U.S.  interests  or  otherwise  made  vulnerable  to \\npressure  or  coercion  by  any  foreign  interest.  Assessment  of  foreign \\n\\n \\n7 \\n \\n\\n\f",
       "contacts  and  interests  should  consider  the  country  in  which  the  foreign \\ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \\nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \\nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \\n \\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \\n\\nAG ¶ 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \\n\\ninformation  or \\n\\n \\n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \\nor  professional  associate,  friend,  or  other  person  who  is  a  citizen  of  or \\nresident  in  a  foreign  country  if  that  contact  creates  a  heightened  risk  of \\nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \\n \\n(b)  connections  to  a  foreign  person,  group,  government,  or  country  that \\ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \\nprotect  classified  or  sensitive \\nthe \\nindividual’s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \\nthat information or technology. \\n \\nThe  nature  of  a  nation’s  government,  its  relationship  with  the  United  States, \\nand its human  rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant’s \\nfamily  members  are  vulnerable  to  government  coercion.  The  risk  of  coercion, \\npersuasion,  or  duress  is  significantly  greater \\nforeign  country  has  an \\nauthoritarian  government,  a  family member is associated with or dependent upon the \\ngovernment,  or  the  country  is  known  to  conduct  intelligence  operations  against  the \\nUnited  States.  In  considering  the  nature  of  the  government,  an  administrative  judge \\nmust  also  consider  any  terrorist  activity  in  the  country  at  issue.  See  generally  ISCR \\nCase  No.  02-26130  at  3  (App.  Bd.  Dec.  7,  2006)  (reversing  decision  to  grant \\nclearance  where  administrative  judge  did  not  consider  terrorist  activity  in  area  where \\nfamily members resided). \\n \\n\\ntechnology  and \\n\\nif \\n\\nthe \\n\\nAG  ¶  7(a)  requires  substantial  evidence  of  a  “heightened  risk.”  The \\n“heightened  risk” required to raise one of these disqualifying conditions is a relatively \\nlow standard.  “Heightened risk” denotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in \\nhaving a family member living under a foreign government. \\n\\n \\nApplicant has not communicated with his ex-girlfriend in Israel since 2007. When \\nApplicant moved back to the United States from Israel in 2007, he had limited social \\nmedia contact with her, her one sister, and several other individuals in Israel with whom \\nhe served in the Israeli military. He deleted all of his social media foreign contacts after \\nhe received the SOR. He has not responded and has no intentions of responding to any \\nattempts  by  these  foreign  contacts  to  reconnect  on  social  media.  While  Applicant \\nmaintains  contact with one individual  with  whom he served in the Israeli military, this \\nindividual is a U.S. citizen and resident with no ties to the Israeli government or military.       \\nAG ¶¶ 7(a) and 7(b) are not established. \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n8 \\n \\n\\n\f",
       "Guideline C, Foreign Preference \\n \\n\\nThe security concern for foreign preference is set out in AG ¶ 9:     \\n \\nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign \\ncountry over the United States, then he or she may provide information or make \\ndecisions  that  are  harmful  to  the  interests  of  the  United  States.  Foreign \\ninvolvement  raises  concerns  about  an  individual's  judgment,  reliability,  and \\ntrustworthiness  when  it  is  in  conflict  with  U.S.  national  interests  or  when  the \\nindividual acts to conceal it. By itself; the fact that a U.S. citizen is also a citizen \\nof  another  country  is  not  disqualifying  without  an  objective  showing  of  such \\nconflict or attempt at concealment. The same is true for a U.S. citizen's exercise \\nof any right or privilege of foreign citizenship and any action to acquire or obtain \\nrecognition of a foreign citizenship. \\n \\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \\n\\nAG ¶ 10. The following is potentially applicable in this case:   \\n\\n \\n(d) participation in foreign activities, including but not limited to: \\n\\n(1) assuming or attempting to assume any type of employment, position, or  \\npolitical office in a foreign government or military organization. \\n\\nApplicant’s service in the Israeli military from November 2004 to February 2006 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nraises AG ¶ 10(d).   \\n \\n\\nConditions that could mitigate foreign preference security concerns are provided  \\n\\nunder AG ¶ 11. The following are potentially applicable: \\n \\n\\n(f)  the  foreign  preference,  if  detected,  involves  a  foreign  country,  entity,  or \\nassociation that poses a low national security risk; and \\n \\n(g) civil employment or military service was authorized under U.S. law, or  \\nthe employment or service was otherwise consented to as required by U.S. law. \\n \\n \\nAs  a  23  year  old,  Applicant  decided  that  serving  in  the  Israeli  military  would \\nenable him to further his desired career in security in support of the U.S. Government. \\nSince  his  longstanding  medical  condition,  which  he  determined  he  did  not  have  to \\ndisclose to the Israeli military, rendered him ineligible to serve in the U.S. military, he \\nviewed  his  decision  as  a  reasonable  option.  That  the  United  States  and  Israel  were \\nallies  with  mutual  adversaries  also  factored  into  his  decision.  He  has  matured  since \\nthen.  He  acknowledged  he  should  have  disclosed  his  medical  condition  to  the  Israeli \\nmilitary. His Israeli military service occurred between 11 and 13 years ago. He no longer \\nhas any ties to the Israeli government or military. He has never been an Israeli citizen, \\nhe  has  never  held  an  Israeli  passport,  and  he  has  never  held  an  Israeli  security \\nclearance. AG ¶¶ 11(f) and 11(g) are applicable. \\n  \\n\\n \\n9 \\n \\n\\n\f",
       "Whole-Person Concept \\n \\nUnder  the  whole-person  concept,  the  administrative  judge  must  evaluate  an \\n \\napplicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s \\nconduct  and  all  relevant  circumstances.  The  administrative  judge  should  consider  the \\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d):  \\n \\n\\nthe  conduct, \\n\\nis  voluntary;  (6) \\n\\nthe  nature,  extent,  and  seriousness  of \\nto \\n\\nthe \\nthe  conduct;  (2) \\n(1) \\ncircumstances  surrounding \\ninclude  knowledgeable \\nparticipation;  (3)  the  frequency  and  recency  of  the  conduct;  (4)  the \\nindividual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \\nwhich  participation \\nthe  presence  or  absence  of \\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \\nfor  the  conduct;  (8)  the  potential  for  pressure,  coercion,  exploitation,  or \\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \\n \\n \\nUnder  AG ¶  2(c), the  ultimate  determination  of  whether to  grant  eligibility  for a \\nsecurity  clearance  must  be  an  overall  commonsense  judgment  based  upon  careful \\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \\n \\n\\nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines B and C in my whole-person \\nanalysis.  After  weighing  the  disqualifying  and  mitigating  conditions  under  both \\nguidelines,  and  evaluating  all  the  evidence  in  the  context  of  the  whole  person,  I \\nconclude  Applicant  has  mitigated  the  foreign  influence  and  foreign  preference \\nsecurity  concerns.  Accordingly,  I  conclude  he  has  carried  his  burden  of  showing \\nthat  it  is  clearly  consistent  with  the  national  interest  to  continue  his  eligibility  for \\naccess to classified information. \\n\\n \\n\\nFormal Findings \\n\\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \\n\\n \\n \\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\nParagraph 1, Guideline C:   \\nSubparagraph 1.a:   \\n \\nParagraph 2, Guideline B:   \\nSubparagraphs 2.a - 2.b: \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\nFor Applicant \\nFor Applicant \\nFor Applicant \\nFor Applicant \\n\\nConclusion \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nIn  light  of  all  of  the  circumstances  presented  by  the  record  in  this  case,  it  is \\nclearly  consistent  with  the  national  interest  to  continue  Applicant’s  eligibility  for  a \\nsecurity clearance.

From these nine conditions, two conditions are applicable to the facts \\nfound in this case: \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and   \\n \\n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \\n \\n \\nFrom  2004  to  the  present,  Applicant  accumulated  17  delinquent  debts,  totaling \\n$129,524 that remain unpaid or unresolved. Applicant has not shown clearly what debts \\nhe paid or is paying beyond his mere statements in his Answer.

An in-depth review of the Items in the file shows \\nno support for his alleged payments.  \\n \\n\\nThe  guideline  in  AG  ¶  20  contains  six  conditions  that  could  mitigate  security \\nconcerns  arising  from  financial  difficulties.  Only  one  mitigating  condition  might  have \\npartial applicability. \\n\\n \\n\\n(b)  the  conditions  that  resulted  in  the  financial  problem  were  largely \\nbeyond  the  person's  control  (e.g.,  loss  of  employment,  a  business \\ndownturn,  unexpected  medical  emergency,  or  a  death,  divorce  or \\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. \\n\\n \\n\\nAG ¶ 20 (b) would apply if his divorce 11 years ago adversely affected his ability \\nto repay his debts. But he also has to act responsibly under the circumstances. It is his \\nburden  of  proof  to  submit  specific  documents  to  demonstrate  those  actions.  However, \\nhe failed to meet his burden of proof on that issue.  \\n\\n \\nLastly,  Applicant  contends  his  medical  problem  in  2010  caused  some  of  his \\ndelinquent debt. Applicant failed to prove AG ¶ 20 (b) applied because he did not submit \\nsufficient evidence of the conditions that he asserted were beyond his control and that \\nhe  acted  responsibly  in  resolving  his  delinquent  debts  during  the  time  the  debts  were \\naccumulating. \\n\\n \\n\\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \\n\\n \\nAG ¶ 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \\n \\nConduct  involving  questionable  judgment,  lack  of  candor,  dishonesty,  or \\nunwillingness  to  comply  with  rules  and  regulations  can  raise  questions \\nabout  an  individual's  reliability,  trustworthiness  and  ability  to  protect \\nclassified  information.  Of  special  interest  is  any  failure  to  provide  truthful \\nand  candid  answers  during  the  security  clearance  process  or  any  other \\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \\n \\nAG  ¶  16  describes  conditions  that  could  raise  a  security  concern  and  may  be \\n\\ndisqualifying: \\n\\n \\n (c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \\nnot  sufficient  for  an  adverse  determination  under  any  other  single \\nguideline,  but  which,  when  considered  as  a  whole,  supports  a  whole-\\nperson  assessment  of  questionable \\njudgment,  untrustworthiness, \\nunreliability,  lack  of  candor,  unwillingness  to  comply  with  rules  and \\nregulations,  or  other  characteristics  indicating  that  the  person  may  not \\nproperly safeguard protected information; \\n\\n \\n\\n5 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n\f",
       " \\n\\n(d)  credible  adverse  information  that  is  not  explicitly  covered  under  any \\nother  guideline  and  may  not  be  sufficient  by  itself  for  an  adverse \\ndetermination,  but  which,  when  combined  with  all  available  information \\nsupports  a  whole-person  assessment  of  questionable \\njudgment, \\nuntrustworthiness,  unreliability,  lack  of  candor,  unwillingness  to  comply \\nwith  rules  and  regulations,  or  other  characteristics  indicating  that  the \\nperson  may  not  properly  safeguard  protected  information.

AG  ¶  16  (c)  and  (d)  apply  to  the  totality  of  Applicant’s  repeated \\nviolations and failure to conform his behavior to expected standards of conduct.  \\n\\n \\nApplicant’s  personal  conduct,  which  consists  of  a  number  repeated  and \\nsignificant  violations  of  company  policies,  creates  a  vulnerability  to  exploitation, \\nmanipulation, or duress because of the frequency and nature of the incidents. Coupled \\nwith his financial debts, Applicant is especially vulnerable to coercion and duress in the \\nhope of extricating himself from his predicament caused by his misconduct and financial \\ndelinquencies.

       " \\n\\nAG  ¶  17  provides  seven  conditions  that  could  mitigate  security  concerns.  A \\nreview of each shows that none apply in this Applicant’s case. His offenses are a series \\nof  transgressions  that  show  an  inattention  to  the  requirements  of  his  position,  casting \\ndoubt  on  his  reliability,  trustworthiness,  and  good  judgment.  AG  ¶  17  (c)  is  not \\nestablished.  \\n \\n\\nApplicant has not acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change \\nhis actions or taken other positive steps to show his course of conduct will not recur. AG \\n¶ 17 (d) does not apply.  \\n \\n\\nApplicant  has  not  taken  positive  action  to  reduce  or  eliminate  vulnerability  to \\n\\nexploitation, manipulation, or duress. AG ¶ 17 (e) is not established.  \\n \\n\\nThe information is substantiated in many documents submitted in the Applicant’s \\n\\nfile. AG ¶ 17 (f) is not established.  \\n \\n\\nFinally, there is no allegation that Applicant associated with persons involved with \\ncriminal  activity,  so  AG  ¶17  (g)  is  not  applicable.  Nor  are  the  first  two  mitigating \\nconditions of any applicability because they apply to false statements by any Applicant \\nor failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \\n \\nWhole-Person Concept \\n\\n \\nUnder  the  whole-person  concept,  the  administrative  judge  must  evaluate  an \\napplicant=s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant=s \\nconduct  and  all  relevant  circumstances.  The  administrative  judge  should  consider  the \\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG &amp; 2(a): \\n\\nthe  nature,  extent,  and  seriousness  of \\nto \\n\\n \\nthe \\nthe  conduct;  (2) \\n(1) \\ncircumstances  surrounding \\ninclude  knowledgeable \\nparticipation;  (3)  the  frequency  and  recency  of  the  conduct;  (4)  the \\nindividual=s  age  and  maturity  at  the  time  of  the  conduct;  (5)  the extent to \\nwhich  participation \\nthe  presence  or  absence  of \\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \\nfor  the  conduct;  (8)  the  potential  for  pressure,  coercion,  exploitation,  or \\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \\n \\n\\nthe  conduct, \\n\\nis  voluntary;  (6) \\n\\nUnder AG &amp; 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \\nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.      \\n\\n \\n\\nI  considered  the  potentially  disqualifying  and  mitigating  conditions  in  light  of  all \\nfacts  and  circumstances  surrounding  this  case.  Applicant  was  an  adult  when  he \\nincurred  the  debts.  He  has  not  taken  any  action  supported  by  objective  evidence  to \\n\\n \\n\\n7 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n\f",
       " \\nresolve his delinquent debts. This inaction leaves him vulnerable to pressure, coercion, \\nexploitation,  or  duress  based  on  the  magnitude  of  his  financial  obligation.  His  lack  of \\naction continues to this day, and is obviously voluntary. His inaction will continue based \\non  his  past  performance.  Applicant  displayed  a  lack  of  good  judgment  incurring  the \\ndebts.  Next,  he  exhibited  a  continued  lack  of  appropriate  judgment  by  failing  to  make \\npayments on any of his delinquent debts during the past seven years. \\n\\n \\nApplicant also has a pattern of violations of work standards set by his employer. \\nHe is an inattentive employee who finds it difficult to conform his behavior to the rules \\nand regulations of his employer. His misconduct has been perpetrated over a decade of \\nemployment. \\n\\n \\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or substantial doubts as to \\nApplicant=s  eligibility  and  suitability  for  a  security  clearance.  For  all  these  reasons,  I \\nconclude  Applicant  did  not  mitigate  the  security  concerns  arising  under  the  guidelines \\nfor Financial Considerations and Personal Conduct.  \\n \\n\\nFormal Findings \\n\\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \\n\\n \\n \\nas required by ¶ E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \\n \\n\\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \\n\\n \\n          Subparagraph 1.a to 1.q: \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:   \\n\\nSubparagraphs 2.a to 2.j:   \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nAGAINST APPLICANT \\n\\nAgainst Applicant \\n\\nAGAINST APPLICANT \\n\\nAgainst Applicant \\n\\nConclusion \\n\\n \\n\\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \\nclearly  consistent  with  the  national  interest  to  grant  Applicant  eligibility  for  a  security \\nclearance.

DOD  CAF  acted  under  Executive \\nOrder  (EO)  10865,  Safeguarding  Classified  Information  within  Industry  (February  20, \\n1960),  as  amended;  DOD  Directive  5220.6,  Defense  Industrial  Personnel  Security \\nClearance  Review  Program  (January  2,  1992),  as  amended  (Directive);  and  the \\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on September 1, 2006. \\n\\n \\nApplicant  answered  the  SOR  on  July  14,  2015,  and  elected  to  have  his  case \\ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.

       "included in the FORM is identified as Items 4-10 and is admitted into the record (Items \\n1-3 are pleadings and transmittal documents). The FORM was mailed to Applicant, who \\nreceived it on October 19, 2015. Applicant was given an opportunity to file objections \\nand submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. He submitted an undated \\nresponse to the FORM, which was admitted without objection as Applicant Exhibit (AE) \\nA. The case was assigned to me on December 21, 2015.  \\n\\nIn Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted all but one of the allegations. The \\nadmissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a careful review of the pleadings and \\nevidence, I make the following additional findings of fact.1 \\n\\n \\nApplicant is 56 years old. He has worked for a defense contractor since 1997. He \\nis divorced and has three children, ages 15, 18, and 20. He has a bachelor’s degree. He \\nhas no military experience.2  \\n \\n \\n \\nApplicant’s conduct raised in the SOR included: a history of consuming alcohol, \\nat times, to excess from 1974 to about April 2014; being found guilty for operating under \\nthe  influence  of  alcohol  (OUI)  in  February  1991;  being  found  guilty  for  OUI  2nd  in \\nNovember 1997; and being found guilty for OUI 3rd in November 2010 (See SOR ¶¶ 1.a \\n- 1.d).3 \\n \\n \\nApplicant  began  drinking  alcohol  when  he  was  approximately  15  years  old  in \\n1974. He drinks beer on most occasions. Even after his OUI convictions, he stated he \\nwas  still  was  consuming  two  to  three  beers  a  week.  He  drinks  in  social  settings  and \\nafter hockey games. As a result of his 2010 OUI conviction, he lost his driver’s license \\nfor five years. He completed his probation in May 2015.4 \\n \\n \\nCourt documents establish that Applicant was found guilty of three OUI offenses, \\nin 1992 (1991 arrest), 2000 (1997 arrest), and 2012 (2010 arrest). He was placed on \\nprobation in each instance.5 \\n \\n \\nIn  February  1991,  Applicant  was  driving  home  from  a  friend’s  house  where  he \\nconsumed  about  four  beers.  He  was  stopped  by  a  police  officer  who  had  observed \\nApplicant’s  car  cross  over  the  center  line.  Applicant  was  given,  and  failed,  a  field \\nsobriety test. He was taken into the police station where he refused a breathalyzer test. \\n                                                           \\n1 Item 2. \\n \\n2 Item 4. \\n \\n3 Items 1, 3. \\n \\n4 Item 10; AE A. \\n \\n5 Item 7, 9; AE A. \\n \\n\\n \\n\\nFindings of Fact \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n2 \\n \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "He was charged with OUI and later pleaded guilty. He was required to attend 12 weeks \\nof alcohol education and counseling classes, which he completed.6 \\n \\n \\nIn November 1997, Applicant was going home from a high school football game \\nwhen he was stopped in traffic by a police officer. Applicant had two beers before the \\ngame  and  shared  a  flask  containing  some  kind  of  alcohol  at  the  game.  The  officer \\napparently  asked  Applicant \\nif  he  had  been  drinking  and  Applicant  answered \\naffirmatively. He was then given field sobriety tests, which he failed. He was arrested, \\ntaken back to the police station and given a breathalyzer test, which he also failed. He \\nwas  found  guilty  of  OUI  and  sentenced  to  two  years’  probation,  loss  of  his  driver’s \\nlicense  for  six  months,  and  12  weeks  required  attendance  at  alcohol  education  and \\ncounseling classes.7 \\n \\n \\nIn  November  2010,  Applicant  was  driving  back  from  a  hockey  tournament  and \\nwas stopped by a state patrolman because he crossed the center line. Applicant had \\nconsumed six beers and shared a flask of whiskey at the hockey tournament. He failed \\nthe  field  sobriety  tests  and  was  almost  incoherent  to  the  patrolman.  He  was  arrested \\nand taken to a police station where he was offered a breathalyzer test. He was unable \\nto properly perform the test, which was deemed a refusal to take the test. He was found \\nguilty of OUI and sentenced to six months’ incarceration, five years of probation, loss of \\ndriver’s  license  for  five  years,  and  mandatory  substance  abuse  evaluation  and \\ntreatment.8 \\n \\nThe court-ordered substance abuse treatment involved two mandatory sessions \\n \\nand  Applicant  voluntarily  attended  six  more  sessions.  He \\nto  provide \\ndocumentation of any evaluation done by the counselors, but Applicant stated he was \\ndiagnosed  as  being  an  alcohol  abuser.  Applicant  also  attended  Alcohol  Anonymous \\n(AA) meetings once every six to eight weeks. He last attended an AA meeting in May \\n2015. He continued to drink an occasional beer every few months. In May 2015, at an \\nAA meeting he heard a story had made him decide to stop drinking alcohol entirely. He \\nclaims he has not had any alcohol since that time.9 \\n \\n\\nfailed \\n\\nfor  a  security  clearance, \\n\\nWhen  evaluating  an  applicant’s  suitability \\n\\n \\nthe \\nadministrative  judge  must  consider  the  adjudicative  guidelines.  In  addition  to  brief \\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \\ndisqualifying  conditions  and  mitigating  conditions,  which  are  used  in  evaluating  an \\napplicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. \\n                                                           \\n6 Item 10. \\n \\n7 Item 10. \\n \\n8 Items 7, 10. \\n \\n9 Item 6-10; AE A. \\n \\n\\nPolicies \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n3 \\n \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "These  guidelines  are  not  inflexible  rules  of  law.  Instead,  recognizing  the \\ncomplexities  of  human  behavior,  these  guidelines  are  applied  in  conjunction  with  the \\nfactors  listed  in  the  adjudicative  process.  The  administrative  judge’s  overarching \\nadjudicative  goal  is  a  fair,  impartial,  and  commonsense  decision.  According  to  AG  ¶ \\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \\nthe  “whole-person  concept.”  The  administrative  judge  must  consider  all  available, \\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \\nmaking a decision. \\n\\n \\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) \\nrequires  that  “[a]ny  doubt  concerning  personnel  being  considered  for  access  to \\nclassified  information  will  be  resolved  in  favor  of  national  security.”  In  reaching  this \\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \\non the evidence contained in the record.  \\n\\n \\nUnder Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \\ncontroverted  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  Under  Directive  ¶  E3.1.15,  an  “applicant  is \\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \\nmitigate  facts  admitted  by  applicant  or  proven  by  Department  Counsel,  and  has  the \\nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.”  \\n\\nthe  Government  predicated  upon \\n\\n \\nA  person  who  seeks  access  to  classified  information  enters  into  a  fiduciary \\nrelationship  with \\ntrust  and  confidence.  This \\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \\nGovernment  reposes  a  high  degree  of  trust  and  confidence  in  individuals  to  whom  it \\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \\nthe  possible  risk  that  an  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  safeguard \\nclassified  information.  Such  decisions  entail  a  certain  degree  of  legally  permissible \\nextrapolation  about  potential,  rather  than  actual,  risk  of  compromise  of  classified \\ninformation. \\n\\n \\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of \\nthe national interest and shall  in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \\napplicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \\n\\nAnalysis \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \\n\\nAG ¶ 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption: \\n\\nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \\njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \\nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \\n\\n \\n4 \\n \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "AG  ¶  22  describes  conditions  that  could  raise  a  security  concern  and  may  be \\n\\ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \\n\\n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \\nthe  influence,  fighting,  child  or  spouse  abuse,  disturbing  the  peace,  or \\nother  incidents  of  concern,  regardless  of  whether  the  individual  is \\ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent;  \\n\\n(c)  habitual  or  binge  consumption  of  alcohol  to  the  point  of  impaired \\njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol \\nabuser or alcohol dependent. \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\nof both disqualifying conditions.  \\n\\nApplicant’s three OUI convictions and his drinking history support the application \\n\\nI  have  also  considered  all  of  the  mitigating  conditions  for  alcohol  consumption \\n\\nunder AG ¶ 23 and found the following relevant: \\n\\n(a)  so  much  time  has  passed,  or  the  behavior  was  so  infrequent,  or  it \\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \\nor good judgment; and \\n\\n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol \\nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \\nhas  established  a  pattern  of  abstinence  (if  alcohol  dependent)  or \\nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser). \\n\\n \\nApplicant’s  last  adverse  alcohol  incident  occurred  in  November  2010  and  he \\ncame  off  probation  for  that  offense  in  May  2015.  His  three  OUI  convictions  are  not \\ninfrequent  under  these  circumstances.  Insufficient  attenuation  exists  to  conclude \\nenough  time  has  passed  since  his  last  alcohol-related  incident.  His  history  of  OUI \\narrests  and  convictions  under  similar  circumstances  suggest  that  recurrence  is  a \\npossibility. His current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment are in doubt. AG ¶ \\n23(a) does not apply. \\n \\nApplicant recently decided to totally abstain from using alcohol. He indicated that \\n \\nhe has abstained since May 2015. While this is a commendable start, it is too soon to \\ndetermine whether his abstinence will continue to be part of his life or whether he will \\nuse alcohol responsibly in the future. AG ¶ 23(b) partially applies.   \\n \\nWhole-Person Concept \\n \\nUnder  the  whole-person  concept,  the  administrative  judge  must  evaluate  an \\n \\napplicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s \\n\\n \\n5 \\n \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  \\n \\n\\nthe  conduct, \\n\\nthe  nature,  extent,  and  seriousness  of \\nto \\n\\n(1) \\nthe  conduct;  (2) \\nthe \\ncircumstances  surrounding \\ninclude  knowledgeable \\nparticipation;  (3)  the  frequency  and  recency  of  the  conduct;  (4)  the \\nindividual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \\nwhich  participation \\nthe  presence  or  absence  of \\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \\nfor  the  conduct;  (8)  the  potential  for  pressure,  coercion,  exploitation,  or \\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \\n \\n\\nis  voluntary;  (6) \\n\\nUnder AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \\nof the guideline and the whole-person concept.        \\n\\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered the circumstances that \\nled  to  his  arrests  and  his  current  state  of  abstinence.  Overall,  the  record  evidence \\nleaves  me  with  questions  and  doubts  as  to  Applicant’s  eligibility  and  suitability  for  a \\nsecurity  clearance.  For  all  these  reasons,  I  conclude  Applicant  failed  to  mitigate  the \\nsecurity concerns under Guideline G. \\n\\nFormal Findings \\n\\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \\n\\n \\n \\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \\n \\n \\n \\n\\nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.d: \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nAgainst Applicant \\n\\nAGAINST APPLICANT \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nConclusion \\n\\n \\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \\nclearly  consistent  with  the  national  interest  to  grant  Applicant  eligibility  for  a  security \\nclearance.

Eligibility  for \\n\\naccess to classified information is granted.  \\n \\n\\nStatement of the Case \\n\\nOn October 28, 2014, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \\nReasons  (SOR)  to  Applicant  detailing  security  concerns  under  Guideline  F,  financial \\nconsiderations. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \\n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \\n1992),  as  amended  (Directive);  and  the  adjudicative  guidelines  (AG)  implemented  by \\nthe DOD on September 1, 2006. \\n\\n \\nApplicant  responded  to  the  SOR  on  November  14,  2014,  and  requested  a \\nhearing  before  an  administrative  judge.  The  case  was  originally  assigned  to  me  on \\nFebruary 27, 2015. Scheduling of the case was delayed because Applicant was working \\noverseas. The case was reassigned to me on May 4, 2015. After coordinating with the \\nparties, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n1 \\n\\n\n",
       "on  July  16,  2015,  scheduling  the  hearing  for  August  18,  2015.  The  hearing  was \\nconvened  as  scheduled.  DOHA  received  the  hearing  transcript  (Tr.)  on  August  26, \\n2015.  \\n \\n\\nEvidentiary Rulings \\n\\nGovernment  Exhibits  (GE)  1,  2,  4,  5,  and  6  were  admitted  in  evidence  without \\nobjection. GE 3 was admitted over Applicant’s objection. Applicant testified, called five \\nwitnesses, and submitted Applicant’s Exhibits (AE) A through Z, which were admitted \\nwithout  objection.  The  record  was  held  open  for  Applicant  to  submit  additional \\ninformation. He submitted documents that I have marked AE AA and BB1 and admitted \\nwithout objection.  \\n \\n\\nFindings of Fact \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\nApplicant is a 57-year-old self-employed contractor for a defense contractor. He \\nserved  in  the  U.S.  military  from  1979  until  he  retired  in  2000.  He  seeks  to  retain  a \\nsecurity clearance, which he has held since he was in the military. He attended college \\nfor a period, but he is a few credits shy of a degree. His first marriage ended in divorce. \\nHe has been married to his current spouse for more than 25 years. He has two adult \\nchildren.2 \\n \\n \\nApplicant spent the majority of his military career in special operations. He went \\non  numerous  combat  missions,  conducted  clandestine  insertions,  and  operated \\nundercover.  When  he  retired  he  became  an  entrepreneur  and  started  his  own \\ncompanies.  His  primary  company  was  incorporated,  but  Applicant  had  to  personally \\nguarantee many of the company’s liabilities. He also invested in real estate. His primary \\ncompany  suffered  significant  setbacks  during  the  recession  and  housing  crisis  of  the \\nlater part of the 2000s. His real estate properties lost much of their value. He closed his \\nprimary  company  in  2009  and  has  been  working  since  then  as  a  self-employed \\ncontractor and subcontractor for other companies. He has spent much of the last five \\nyears working overseas in dangerous assignments.3 \\n \\n  \\nThe SOR alleges nine delinquent debts, which include a $58,161 judgment (SOR \\n¶  1.a),  mortgage  loans  (SOR  ¶  1.c  -  $30,994;  SOR  ¶  1.d  -  $351,562;  SOR  ¶  1.e  - \\n$271,900; and SOR ¶ 1.f - $50,688), two business-related debts (SOR ¶ 1.b - $18,028 \\nand SOR ¶ 1.h - $77,115) and federal taxes (SOR ¶ 1.g - $33,882 for tax year 2008, \\nand SOR ¶ 1.i – no amount alleged for tax years 2012 and 2013). Applicant admitted \\nowing most of the debts at some point, but several of the debts were paid, settled, or \\notherwise resolved. \\n \\n\\n                                                           \\n1  Counsel  marked  the  post-hearing  submissions  as  Z  and  AA,  but  AE  Z  was  already  admitted  at  the \\nhearing.  \\n \\n2 Tr. at 118, 123-127, 184; GE 1, 3 AE A. \\n \\n3 Tr. at 28-31, 120, 127-131; GE 1, 3; AE A, T. \\n\\n \\n2 \\n\\n\n",
       " \\nApplicant’s primary company was growing, and it leased a larger warehouse in \\nabout  2008.  The  business  ultimately  failed,  and  the  company  broke  the  lease.  The \\nowner of the warehouse sued  Applicant  personally  and  obtained a $58,161 judgment \\nagainst  him  (SOR  ¶  1.a).  Applicant’s  attorney  is  negotiating  a  settlement  on  this \\njudgment.4  \\n \\n \\nApplicant and a partner had a falling out over the business. The ex-partner sued \\nApplicant  for  $160,000.  They  reached  a  settlement  through  arbitration  in  which \\nApplicant agreed to pay the ex-partner $163,000 by 2010. He paid about $86,000, but \\nhe  was  unable  to  pay  the  remainder  when  the  company  closed.  The  partner  either \\nobtained  a  judgment  for  $77,000  or  sought  to  enforce  the  arbitrated  settlement. \\nApplicant’s  attorney  is  negotiating  a  settlement  for  the  remainder  owed  to  the  ex-\\npartner.5 \\n \\nIn February 2013, Applicant settled the $20,302 business credit card debt alleged \\n \\nin  SOR  ¶  1.b  (alleged  as  $18,028  in  SOR)  for  $10,151,  which  was  paid  in  February \\n2013. Applicant submitted proof in his response to DOHA interrogatories in May 2014 \\nthat the debt had been settled. The February 2014 credit report lists the account with a \\nzero balance, with the annotation that it was transferred, sold, and paid.6 \\n \\n \\nApplicant was due a refund from his 2007 federal income taxes, but he owed the \\nIRS for tax year 2008. The IRS filed a $33,882 tax lien against Applicant in June 2010 \\n(SOR ¶ 1.g). In January 2011, the IRS applied his $15,892 refund from his 2007 taxes \\nto his 2008 taxes. Applicant paid the remaining $5,689 owed for 2008 in January 2013. \\nThe  2014  credit  reports  obtained  by  the  Government  report  the  lien  as  released  in \\nJanuary 2013.7 \\n \\n \\nApplicant owed the IRS $65,863 for his 2012 and 2013 federal income taxes. In \\nApril  2015,  he  submitted  a  proposed  installment  agreement  to  the  IRS  whereby  he \\nwould  pay  an  initial  $915  and  then  $500  per  month  until  paid.  In  July  2015,  the  IRS \\naccepted  Applicant’s  installment  agreement  and  added  his  2014  taxes.  On  June  5, \\n2015,  Applicant  paid  the  IRS  $56,415  for  his  2014  taxes.  On  July  9,  2015,  he  paid \\n$10,000 toward his estimated taxes for 2015.8 \\n \\n \\nApplicant used to own five properties consisting of his residence and four rental \\nproperties. Some of his tenants did not pay their rent, and he also had a property vacant \\nfor an extended period. Applicant bought his home and another property when he was \\nin the military. He still has those properties, plus another, but he lost two properties to \\nforeclosure.

He credibly testified that it will \\ntake time, but he is committed to resolving all his debts.14  \\n \\n \\nApplicant’s character evidence was extraordinary. He submitted numerous letters \\nand  several  witnesses  testified.  Many  of  the  authors  and  witnesses  served  with \\nApplicant in special operations. His former commanding officer testified that he served \\nwith  Applicant  under  conditions  that  the  commanding  officer  modesty  described  as \\n“quite  stressful.”  The  endorsements  of  the  witnessses  and  authors  were  unequivocal \\nand exceptional.15 \\n \\n\\nPolicies \\n\\n \\n\\nWhen  evaluating  an  applicant’s  suitability \\n\\n \\nthe \\nadministrative  judge  must  consider  the  adjudicative  guidelines.  In  addition  to  brief \\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \\ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \\napplicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. \\n \\n\\nfor  a  security  clearance, \\n\\nThese  guidelines  are  not  inflexible  rules  of  law.  Instead,  recognizing  the \\ncomplexities  of  human  behavior,  administrative  judges  apply  the  guidelines  in \\nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s \\noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \\nto  AG  ¶  2(c),  the  entire  process  is  a  conscientious  scrutiny  of  a  number  of  variables \\nknown  as  the  “whole-person  concept.”  The  administrative  judge  must  consider  all \\navailable,  reliable  information  about  the  person,  past  and  present,  favorable  and \\nunfavorable, in making a decision. \\n\\n \\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) \\nrequires  that  “[a]ny  doubt  concerning  personnel  being  considered  for  access  to \\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.”  \\n\\n \\nUnder Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \\ncontroverted  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  Under  Directive  ¶  E3.1.15,  the  applicant  is \\nresponsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \\nor  mitigate  facts  admitted  by  the  applicant  or  proven  by  Department  Counsel.”  The \\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \\n\\nthe  Government  predicated  upon \\n\\n \\nA  person  who  seeks  access  to  classified  information  enters  into  a  fiduciary \\n \\nrelationship  with \\ntrust  and  confidence.  This \\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \\nGovernment  reposes  a  high  degree  of  trust  and  confidence  in  individuals  to  whom  it \\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \\nthe  possible  risk  the  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  safeguard \\nclassified  information.  Such  decisions  entail  a  certain  degree  of  legally  permissible \\n                                                           \\n14 Tr. at 50, 180-181, 190-193, 197; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 3 ; AE A, U, W, Y. \\n \\n15 Tr. at 25-28, 50-51, 62-74; AE B-L, T. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n5 \\n\\n\n",

       "(c)  the  person  has  received  or  is  receiving  counseling  for  the  problem \\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \\nunder control; and \\n\\n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \\notherwise resolve debts. \\n\\n \\nApplicant owed and still owes a lot of money, but the SOR overstated his debts. \\n  \\nThe evidence available to the Government (credit reports and documents submitted by \\nApplicant in response to interrogatories) established that before the SOR was issued, \\nApplicant  settled  the  $18,028  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.b,  and  he  paid  the  IRS  the \\n$33,882 alleged in SOR ¶ 1.g. Additionally, the SOR alleged the high credit on the two \\nmortgage  loans  (SOR  ¶¶  1.d  -  $351,562  and  1.e  -  $271,900),  when  the  balances  on \\nthose loans were reported as zero.  \\n \\n  \\nApplicant paid his 2008 federal income taxes. He has a payment plan in place for \\nhis  2012  and  2013  tax  years.  He  settled  and  paid  the  second  mortgage  loan  on  his \\nhome,  and  he  paid  other  debts  that  were  not  alleged  in  the  SOR.  His  attorney  is \\nnegotiating  settlements  for  the  two  judgments  against  him.  Applicant  credibly  testified \\nthat it will take time, but he is committed to resolving all his debts. \\n \\n \\nI find that Applicant established a plan to resolve his financial problems, and he \\ntook significant action to implement that plan. He acted responsibly and made a good-\\nfaith effort to pay his debts. There are clear indications that his financial problems are \\nbeing  resolved  and  are  under  control.  They  occurred  under  circumstances  that  are \\nunlikely  to  recur  and  do  not  cast  doubt  on  his  current  reliability,  trustworthiness,  and \\ngood judgment. AG ¶¶ 20(c) and 20(d) are applicable. AG ¶ 20(b) is partially applicable. \\nAG ¶ 20(a) is not yet completely applicable because Applicant is still in the process of \\npaying his debts.  \\n \\nWhole-Person Concept \\n \\nUnder  the  whole-person  concept,  the  administrative  judge  must  evaluate  an \\n \\napplicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s \\nconduct  and  all  relevant  circumstances.  The  administrative  judge  should  consider  the \\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nthe  conduct, \\n\\nthe  nature,  extent,  and  seriousness  of \\nto \\n\\nthe  conduct;  (2) \\nthe \\n(1) \\ncircumstances  surrounding \\ninclude  knowledgeable \\nparticipation;  (3)  the  frequency  and  recency  of  the  conduct;  (4)  the \\nindividual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \\nwhich  participation \\nthe  presence  or  absence  of \\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \\nfor  the  conduct;  (8)  the  potential  for  pressure,  coercion,  exploitation,  or \\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \\n\\nis  voluntary;  (6) \\n\\n \\n7 \\n\\n\n",
       " \\nUnder AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \\nsecurity  clearance  must  be  an  overall  commonsense  judgment  based  upon  careful \\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \\n \\n\\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions  in  light  of  all \\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \\nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis.  \\n\\n \\nApplicant’s  character  evidence  was  extraordinary.  His  financial  problems  are \\nlarge, but not insurmountable. Applicant credibly testified that he will eventually resolve \\nall his debts. His sacrifices in service to this country have earned him the time to do so. \\n\\n \\nOverall,  the  record  evidence  leaves  me  without  questions  or  doubts  as  to \\nApplicant’s  eligibility  and  suitability  for  a  security  clearance.  I  conclude  Applicant \\nmitigated the financial considerations security concerns.  \\n \\n\\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \\n\\nFormal Findings \\n\\n \\n \\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.i: \\n \\n\\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \\n\\nFor Applicant \\n\\nFor Applicant \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nConclusion \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nIn  light  of  all  of  the  circumstances  presented  by  the  record  in  this  case,  it  is \\nclearly  consistent  with  the  national  interest  to  continue  Applicant’s  eligibility  for  a \\nsecurity clearance.

       "Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Notice of Hearing on September 3, \\n2015, and the hearing was convened as scheduled on September 22, 2015.  \\n\\n \\nAt the hearing, Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through \\n4. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through F. The record of \\nthe  proceedings  was  left  open  until  October  5,  2015,  to  provide  Applicant  the \\nopportunity to submit additional documents. He timely submitted documents that were \\nmarked as AE G thought I. All exhibits were admitted into evidence without objections. \\nDOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on September 30, 2015. \\n \\n\\nProcedural Matters \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nDepartment Counsel made a motion to withdraw the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.d \\nand 1.e. Applicant had no objection to the motion. The motion was granted, and those \\nallegations were withdrawn.1 \\n \\n \\nDepartment Counsel made a motion to amend SOR ¶ 1.a to reflect that the debt \\nwas owed to a state instead of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Applicant had no \\nobjection to the amendment. The motion to amend was granted.2 \\n \\n\\nFindings of Fact \\n\\n \\n \\nApplicant is a 40-year-old mechanic who works as a quality assurance inspector \\nfor  a  defense  contractor.  He  has  been  working  for  that  contractor  in  the  Middle  East \\nsince May 2011 and has worked overseas for other defense contractors for a number of \\nyears.  He  earned  a  general  educational  development  certificate  in  1996  and  an \\nassociate’s degree in 2003. He has been married twice. He married his current wife in \\n2005. He has three children, ages 15, 16, and 22.3 \\n \\n\\nExcluding  the  withdrawn  allegations,  the  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  had  three \\ndelinquent  debts  totaling  $64,168  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.c).  In  his  Answer  to  the  SOR,  he \\ndenied each debt. Substantial evidence of the alleged debts is contained in GE 1-4.4  \\n\\n \\nIn 1999, Applicant was involved in a car accident and incurred a broken pelvis \\nand hip. He was determined to be fully disabled and collected about $1,000 per month \\nin disability payments from the Social Security Administration (SSA). While receiving the \\ndisability benefits, he knew there was a limit on how much income he could earn, but \\ndid not know the exact restrictions. In 2006, he received a letter from SSA that indicated \\n                                                           \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n1 Tr. 23-25.  \\n\\n2 Tr. 43-44.  \\n\\n3 Tr. 5-7, 23, 37-39, 42-43; GE 1. \\n\\n4 GE 1-4; Applicant’s Answer to the SOR.  \\n\\n \\n2 \\n \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "he was earning more income than he was allowed. At that time, his disability payments \\nstopped, and he has not received any further disability payments since then.5 \\n\\n \\nA credit report dated June 12, 2010, reflected that Applicant’s SSA account had \\nbeen  placed  for  collection  in  the  amount  of  $20,955  (SOR  ¶  1.c).  This  delinquent \\naccount was the result of his overpayment of disability payments. In 2008, he started \\nrepaying this debt through a monthly pay allotment of $300. When he left his job later \\nthat year, the allotment stopped. In 2012, the SSA began garnishing his pay at a rate of \\n$600 every two weeks. By early 2014 (well before the issuance of the SOR), he fully \\nrepaid this debt. In July 2014, he received a letter from the SSA stating he overpaid the \\ndebt and would be receiving a refund of $2,535.6 \\n\\n \\nIn 2008 and 2009, Applicant worked overseas, and a portion of his income was \\nexempt from taxation. In those years, his income was greater than the exemption, and \\nhe incurred taxes that he could not pay. In his security clearance application (SCA), he \\ndisclosed that he owed approximately $36,000 to the IRS for 2008 and 2009 (SOR ¶ \\n1.b). In 2010, his state also filed a $7,213 tax lien against him (SOR ¶ 1.a).7 \\n\\n \\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant stated that the state tax lien had been repaid \\nthrough monthly payroll deductions. He also stated that he had a repayment plan with \\nthe IRS and the payments are automatically deducted from his pay.8  \\n\\n  \\nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that the state tax lien was repaid, but he had \\nnot  yet  received  a  document  from  the  state  showing  it  was  paid.  He  stated  that  the \\ndeductions from his pay for the state tax lien stopped over a year ago. At the hearing, \\nhe also provided IRS account transcripts for 2008 and 2009 that showed he had been \\nconsistently  making  monthly  payments  of  $375  since  August  2012.  As  of  September \\n2015,  his  IRS  account  balance  for  2008  was  $3,961  and  for  2009  was  $17,124.  The \\naccount transcripts showed that his IRS debt had been cut almost in half.9 \\n\\n  \\nBesides the debts alleged in the SOR, Applicant’s credit report dated March 26, \\n2015, reflected that he had no other delinquent debts. He also testified that he had no \\nother delinquent debts. In 2014, he earned about $108,000 and his wife earned about \\n$25,000. In his post-hearing submission, Applicant presented letters from the state that \\nreflected he did not have an outstanding tax liability for 2008 and 2009.10 \\n\\n                                                           \\n\\n5 Tr. 26-29; GE 1. \\n \\n6 Tr. 29-32; GE 1-3; AE C. \\n \\n7 Tr. 32-36; GE 1.    \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n8 Applicant’s Answer to the SOR. \\n\\n9 Tr. 32-36, 46-51; AE D-F. \\n\\n10 Tr. 39-42; AE A, B, H, I; Applicant’s Answer to the SOR. \\n\\n \\n3 \\n \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "Policies \\n\\n \\n\\nThe  President  of  the  United  States  has  the  authority  to  control  access  to \\ninformation  bearing  on  national  security  and  to  determine  whether  an  individual  is \\nsufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. Department of the Navy v. \\nEgan,  484  U.S.  518,  527  (1988).  The  President  has  authorized  the  Secretary  of \\nDefense to grant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it \\nis clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \\nClassified  Information  within  Industry  §  2  (Feb.  20,  1960),  as  amended.  The  U.S. \\nSupreme  Court  has  recognized  the  substantial  discretion  of  the  Executive  Branch  in \\nregulating  access  to  information  pertaining  to  national  security,  emphasizing  that  “no \\none  has  a  ‘right’  to  a  security  clearance.”  Department  of  the  Navy  v.  Egan,  484  U.S. \\n518, 528 (1988). \\n\\n \\nEligibility  for  a  security  clearance  is  predicated  upon  the  applicant  meeting  the \\ncriteria  contained  in  the  adjudicative  guidelines.  These  AGs  are  not  inflexible  rules  of \\nlaw.  Instead,  recognizing  the  complexities  of  human  behavior,  these  guidelines  are \\napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s \\nadjudicative  goal  is  a  fair,  impartial,  and  commonsense  decision.  An  administrative \\njudge  must  consider  all  available,  reliable  information  about  the  person,  past  and \\npresent, favorable and unfavorable, in reaching a decision.  \\n\\n \\nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \\naccess  to  classified  information.  This  relationship  transcends  normal  duty  hours  and \\nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \\npossible  risk  that  the  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  safeguard \\nclassified  information.  Such  decisions  entail  a  certain  degree  of  legally  permissible \\nextrapolation  of  potential,  rather  than  actual,  risk  of  compromise  of  classified \\ninformation. Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in \\nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. \\nOr.  10865  §  7.  See  also  Executive  Order  12968  (Aug.  2,  1995),  Section  3.  Thus,  a \\nclearance  decision  is  merely  an  indication  that  the  Applicant  has  or  has  not  met  the \\nstrict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing \\na clearance. \\n\\n \\nInitially,  the  Government  must  establish,  by  substantial  evidence,  conditions  in \\nthe  personal  or  professional  history  of  the  applicant  that  may  disqualify  the  applicant \\nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \\nof  establishing  controverted  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  See  Egan,  484  U.S.  at  531.  \\n“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. \\nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \\npresume  a  nexus  or  rational  connection  between  proven  conduct  under  any  of  the \\ncriteria listed and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \\n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n4 \\n \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "Once  the  Government  establishes  a  disqualifying  condition  by  substantial \\nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \\nfacts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \\nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue [his or her] security \\nclearance.”  ISCR  Case  No.  01-20700  at  3  (App.  Bd.  Dec.  19,  2002).  The  burden  of \\ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. \\n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \\nif they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   \\n\\nAnalysis \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \\n\\n \\nThe security concern for this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 18 as follows: \\n\\n \\n\\nFailure  or  inability  to  live  within  one’s  means,  satisfy  debts,  and  meet \\nfinancial  obligations  may  indicate  poor  self-control,  lack  of  judgment,  or \\nunwillingness  to  abide  by  rules  and  regulations,  all  of  which  can  raise \\nquestions  about  an  individual’s  reliability,  trustworthiness  and  ability  to \\nprotect  classified \\nfinancially \\noverextended  is  at  risk  of  having  to  engage  in  illegal  acts  to  generate \\nfunds.  \\n \\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \\n\\ninformation.

Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \\n\\n \\n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and  \\n\\n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nThe  evidence  established  that  Applicant  accumulated  delinquent  debts  that  he \\nwas unable or unwilling to pay for an extended period. AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) apply in \\nthis case. \\n \\n \\napplicable:  \\n \\n\\nFour financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially \\n\\n(a)  the  behavior  happened  so  long  ago,  was  so  infrequent,  or  occurred \\nunder  such  circumstances  that  it  is  unlikely  to  recur  and  does  not  cast \\ndoubt  on  the  individual’s  current  reliability,  trustworthiness,  or  good \\njudgment; \\n \\n(b)  the  conditions  that  resulted  in  the  financial  problem  were  largely \\nbeyond  the  person’s  control  (e.g.,  loss  of  employment,  a  business \\ndownturn,  unexpected  medical  emergency,  or  a  death,  divorce  or \\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \\n\\n \\n5 \\n \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "(c)  the  person  has  received  or  is  receiving  counseling  for  the  problem \\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \\nunder control; and \\n \\n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \\notherwise resolve debts.  \\n \\nApplicant  incurred  delinquent  debts  because  he  continued  to  receive  disability \\nbenefits  after  his  income  exceeded  earning  limitations  and  because  he  failed  to  pay \\ntaxes  on  income  earned  in  2008  and  2009.  These  events  do  not  constitute \\ncircumstances beyond his control. AG ¶ 20(b) does not apply. \\n\\n \\nApplicant  has  resolved  the  state  tax  lien  in  SOR  ¶  1.a  and  the  disability \\noverpayment  in  SOR  ¶  1.c.  He  has  established  a  repayment  plan  to  resolve  the \\ndelinquent  federal  taxes  in  SOR  ¶  1.b.  He  has  been  consistently  making  payments \\nunder  that  plan  for  the  past  three  years.  The  record  established  that  his  financial \\nproblems  are  under  control  and  are  being  resolved.  He  has  not  incurred  any  recent \\ndelinquent debts. His financial problems are unlikely to recur and do not cast doubt on \\nhis current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.

Zaid, Esq. \\n\\n \\n\\nHARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: \\n \\nApplicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) alleges two allegations under Guideline \\n \\nK  (handling  protected  information)  and  five  allegations  under  Guideline  E  (personal \\nconduct).  All  allegations  relate  to  his  handling  of  confidential  data  in  December  2007 \\nand January 2008 and his participation in the follow-up investigation in 2009 and 2010. \\nApplicant was assured that “trusted downloads” provided by the Navy and Company L \\ndid not contain classified information, when two of them contained a mix of unclassified \\nand  classified  information.  Applicant  and  his  team  members  transferred  the  trusted \\ndownloads onto computers that were for unclassified use only. There was no evidence \\nthat any of the classified information was viewed by anyone not authorized to view it. \\nApplicant made some judgment errors in his reaction to the discovery of the classified \\ninformation. In March 2008, Applicant’s attorney offered to provide requested materials \\nto the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI); Applicant cooperated with the investigation; \\nand  Applicant’s  errors  in  judgment  are  not  recent.  He  credibly  assured  conscientious \\ncompliance with security rules. He presented a strong case of whole-person mitigation. \\nSecurity concerns are mitigated. Access to classified information is granted.      \\n  \\n\\nHistory of the Case \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nOn  February  11,  2011,  Applicant  completed  and  signed  an  Electronic \\nQuestionnaires  for  Investigations  Processing  (e-QIP)  (SF  86).

(Hearing  Exhibit  (HE)  2)  Specifically,  the  SOR  set  forth  security \\nconcerns arising under Guidelines K and E.   \\n\\n  \\nOn  September  2,  2014,  Applicant  responded  to  the  SOR,  and  he  requested  a \\nhearing.  On  July  23,  2015,  Department  Counsel  was  ready  to  proceed.  On  July  30, \\n2015,  the  case  was  assigned  to  me.  On  November  12,  2015,  the  Defense  Office  of \\nHearings  and  Appeals  (DOHA)  issued  a  notice  of  hearing,  setting  the  hearing  for \\nDecember 14, 2015. (HE 1) The hearing was held as scheduled. On December 7, 2015, \\nDepartment  Counsel  moved  to  amend  the  allegation  in  SOR  ¶  1.b.  There  was  no \\nobjection,  and  I  granted  the  motion.  During  the  hearing,  Department  Counsel  offered \\nseven  exhibits,  which  were  admitted  into  evidence  without  objection,  and  Applicant \\noffered  18  exhibits,  which  were  admitted  without  objection.  (Transcript  (Tr.)  17-21; \\nGovernment  Exhibit  (GE)  1-7;  Applicant  Exhibit  (AE)  A-R)  On  December  22,  2015,  I \\nreceived a transcript of the hearing.   \\n\\n  \\n\\nFindings of Fact \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nIn  Applicant’s  SOR  response,  he  denied  all  of  the  SOR  allegations.  Applicant \\nadmitted the information in amended SOR ¶ 1.b. Applicant’s admissions are accepted \\nas findings of fact.  \\n \\n\\nApplicant is a 56-year-old software engineer employed by Company D, a defense \\ncontractor from 1980 to 2007. (Tr. 179, 214; AE A) From 2008 to present, he has been \\nemployed by another defense contractor. (AE A) In January 2011, Applicant’s security \\nclearance was suspended. (GE 2; AE E)  \\n\\n \\nIn 1998, Applicant married. (Tr. 235) His spouse is a missile engineer, and she \\nhas a security clearance. (Tr. 216) He has two daughters who are 14 and 15. (Tr. 215) \\nHis  father  was  a  career  Navy  officer.  (Tr.  215)  His  two  older  brothers  served  in  the \\nNavy. (Tr. 215) His nephew was a Navy Seal, who served three tours in Afghanistan. \\n(Tr. 215) Applicant never served in the military. (Tr. 235) \\n\\n \\nCompany D funded Applicant’s college tuition, and in 1982, Applicant received a \\nbachelor  of  science  degree  in  mathematics.  (Tr.  178-179,  235;  AE  A)  After  1982, \\nApplicant worked on a variety of Navy contracts for Company D.  Sometimes he was \\nemployed at Company D, but detailed to work on Company L managed projects. (Tr. \\n180) During Desert Shield, he was deployed for six months to the Persian Gulf aboard a \\nU.S. Navy vessel. (Tr. 180) \\n\\n \\n2 \\n                                         \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "In 1999, Applicant was one of the architects of a program for a simulation test of \\npart of a weapons system developed by Company L by utilizing unclassified data. (Tr. \\n184;  GE  5;  GE  6)  From  1999  to  2007,  Applicant  was  instrumental  in  the  program \\ndevelopment. (Tr. 184-189). In November 2007, Applicant went to the Pentagon, and in \\nthe  presence  of  an  admiral,  was  shown  some  design  charts,  which  Applicant  had \\ndeveloped on behalf of Company D, and Company L had previously presented without \\nauthorization to the Navy. (Tr. 189) Applicant believed the information was improperly \\ntaken from Company D by Company L.  \\n\\n \\n\\nHandling Protected Information and Personal Conduct1  \\n\\n \\nApplicant was the leader of a team of technicians working on a Navy project. (Tr. \\n99; GE 5 at 1-2) On about 75 occasions over several years, Company L employees or \\nNavy personnel provided “trusted downloads” on flash drives or compact discs, which \\nwere supposed to be unclassified data or software that Applicant and his team could \\nuse  for  analysis.  (Tr.  94,  99-103;  GE  6  at  7)  Technicians  were  concerned  that  a  file \\nmarked  unclassified  might  actually  contain  classified  data.  (Tr.  87)  The  only  way \\nclassified information could be placed on unclassified computers was through an error \\nin  the  trusted-download  process,  or  a  deliberate  improper  transfer  of  classified \\ninformation. (Tr. 78) Applicant was not authorized to make a trusted download, and he \\ndenied knowingly transferring classified information to an unclassified computer. (Tr. 78)  \\nThere are eight or nine people that could have been responsible for entering data that \\nwas too close to the thresholds to be unclassified. (Tr. 214) \\n\\n \\nApplicant’s team’s project utilized a classified version and an unclassified version \\nof a computer program. The classified version used “a set of parameters, thresholds, \\nwhich [were] put together along with the executable part of the program” to generate a \\n“classified  result.”  (Tr.  100,  107)  The  classified  numbers  changed  as  the  project \\nadvanced.  (Tr.  122-123)  M  was  a  key  person  in  deciding  whether  data  should  be \\nclassified or not. (Tr. 128) The unclassified version of the program used numbers that \\nwere not representative of the real system to simulate interactions, which allowed use of \\nlaptops and communications in an unclassified environment and improved productivity. \\n(Tr. 100-101, 107) The non-representative numbers were used “to test the mechanics of \\nthe  program”  and  debug  problems  in  an  unclassified  environment.  (Tr.  108)  The \\nclassified numbers were not supposed to be used on unclassified computers. (Tr. 112) \\nM assumed the computer he was issued was from Company L and not from DOD. (Tr. \\n113) The unclassified versions could be used at home. (Tr. 100-102) Employees were \\nallowed to use company-issued computers for some personal use; however, extensive \\npersonal use was discouraged. (Tr. 124) At Company L, if a spillage was discovered, \\nCompany L’s facility security officer (FSO) was supposed to be notified. (Tr. 115) The \\nFSO was responsible for ensuring the file was deleted from computers. (Tr. 116) After \\ndeletion of the file, security used a cleaning program to scramble the computer memory. \\n\\n                                            \\n\\n1Unless stated otherwise, the source for the information in this section is a December 16, 2010, \\nletter from an FBI special agent written to the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) about \\nthe investigation of Applicant for unauthorized removal and retention of classified documents or material \\nin possible violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1924. (GE 3)   \\n\\n \\n3 \\n                                         \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "(Tr.  116)  Applicant  had  access  to  classified  versions  of  the  program  and  classified \\nprogram data. (Tr. 118) \\n\\n \\nEmployees  of  Companies  D  and  L  sought  to  maintain  separation  between  the \\nclassified  and  unclassified  versions.  (Tr.  101,  106-108)  In  2008,  the  security  people \\ninterviewed employees and borrowed computers with the programs on their computers \\nto check for a data spill. (Tr. 102) Security found files containing classified information \\non the computers of four to seven employees of Company L, including on M’s computer. \\n(Tr.  102-103,  118-121)  Security  performed  cleansing  operations  on  the  computers  to \\neliminate  the  files  with  classified  information.  (Tr.  102-103,  118-121)  Because  of  the \\nspillage,  the  whole  unclassified-simulation  program  was  terminated,  and  all  future \\nsimulation work was done on the classified side. (Tr. 119, 124) Team members worked \\non  different  areas  of  the  program.  (Tr.  104-105)  Their  work  would  be  subsequently \\nmerged,  which  could  cause  classified  data  to  be  unknowingly  transferred  from  one \\ncomputer to another, and no one would know the origin of the classified information. (Tr. \\n104-105)      \\n\\n \\n4 \\n                                         \\n \\n\\n \\nIn December 2007, Applicant received a trusted download onto a flash drive from \\nthe  Navy  for  evaluation  of  Applicant  and  his  team.  (Tr.  221;  GE  5;  GE  6)  The \\ninformation was supposed to unclassified. Classified files from downloads were labeled \\nwith a C, and unclassified files from trusted downloads were labeled with a T for test. \\n(Tr. 192) In December 2007, B, a GS-13, who was the senior Navy employee on the \\nteam,  was  at  Applicant’s  residence,  when  they  were  doing  some computer  work.  (Tr. \\n92, 192) Applicant inserted a flash drive into B’s laptop computer and was surprised to \\nsee a file starting with a C, which meant the file could be classified. (Tr. 193, 217-218; \\nGE 5 at 2) Applicant had previously transferred the data from the flash drive to his DOD-\\nissued laptop computer without noticing the C-file. (Tr. 217) Applicant and B reviewed \\nthe content of the C-file and determined it was too “inchoate” and lacked a specification \\nto  be  classified.  (Tr.  193)  Nothing  inside  the  C-file  was  marked  classified,  and  the \\ncontent of the C-file never made it into a specification. (Tr. 193-194)  \\n\\n \\nIn  December  2007,  the  information  from  the  flash  drive  would  have  been \\nclassified; however, by 2015, it was clear that at most it was sensitive information. (Tr. \\n194, 220; GE 5 at 2) In 2007, the classification level for the data found on Applicant’s \\ncomputer  was  probably  confidential.  (GE  6 at  4)  B  and  Applicant  agreed  that  the file \\nshould be deleted, and B suggested that Applicant download a cleaning program to be \\nsure  it  was  deleted.  (Tr.  193;  GE  4  at  2;  GE  6  at  2)  They  deleted  the  file.  (Tr.  162) \\nApplicant obtained a cleaning program, which wipes out inactive files. (Tr. 195-196)2 It \\ndeletes files from the recycle bin. (Tr. 224) Applicant conceded it was bad judgment to \\ndelete  the  file  without  going  to  security.  (Tr.  195,  235)  Applicant  has  never  had  any \\nsecurity violations. (Tr. 195) Applicant did not disclose the possible transfer of classified \\ninformation  to  an  unclassified  system  until  August  19,  2010  when  he  met  with  an \\n                                            \\n\\n2Applicant is not the only team member with a clearing program on his DOD-issued computer. C \\nhas a cleaning or deletion program on his computer. (Tr. 80) C understood that if classified information \\nwere  found  on  an  unclassified  computer  the  safest  reaction  is  to  delete  the  classified  information  to \\nensure its protection from loss or compromise. (Tr. 80-81) The spillage should  also be reported  to the \\nFSO. (Tr. 85-86) \\n\\n\n",
       "Assistant U.S. Attorney (AUSA) and others for a proffer session. Applicant promised to \\nreport any spillage that occurs immediately to his company (FSO). (Tr. 214)   \\n\\n \\nOn January 18, 2008, two employees of a rival defense contractor (Company L) \\ntold investigators that Applicant may be responsible for the unauthorized removal and \\nretention of classified materials. (GE 4) \\n\\n \\nOn  January  28,  2008,  Company  D’s  FSO  called  Applicant  and  asked  him  to \\nprovide his two DOD-issued laptop computers to Company L. (Tr. 196, 229) One of the \\nrequested laptop computers was at Applicant’s home. (Tr. 197-199) The FSO did not \\nexplain why the computers were requested. (Tr. 199) Applicant said he would bring the \\ncomputers the next day, and the FSO did not insist or demand that Applicant provide \\nthe computer sooner. (GE 6 at 6) Applicant did not believe there had been classified \\ninformation on the laptop computers. (Tr. 200) Applicant said he deleted  some family \\npictures and other personal information that he did not want to release. (Tr. 139-140, \\n162-163,  169-170,  202,  227-229)  On  January  29,  2008,  Applicant  turned  in  the  two \\nlaptop computers. (GE 6 at 2) \\n\\n \\nIn  early  February  2008,  Applicant  went  to  another  state  where  there  was  a \\ncomputer  with  the  same  program.  Two  subject  matter  experts  (SMEs),  who  were \\nassociated with Applicant’s team, reviewed the “unclassified data” on the hard drive and \\ndetermined  that  there was  probably  classified  data  on  the  computer.  (Tr.  76-77,  205, \\n213;  GE  6  at  2-3)  Most  of  the  information  was  unclassified;  however,  the  classified \\ninformation  was  one  table  of  numbers  or  parameters,  and  none  of  the  SMEs  were \\naware  of  how  the  classified  table  had  migrated  from  the  classified  system  to  the \\nunclassified  system.  (Tr.  77,  88,  90,  213,  232-233)  In  February  2008,  Applicant \\ncontacted Company D’s FSO and advised her of the possibility of confidential data on \\nteam computers. The computers were collected to detect any spillage. (Tr. 205-206; GE \\n6 at 4) One of the SMEs also contacted his FSO about the possible spillage. (Tr. 206)   \\n\\n \\nApplicant  consulted  a  Navy  captain,  who  advised  Applicant  to  seek  the \\nassistance of counsel, and in February 2008, he hired a counsel with significant national \\nsecurity  experience.  (Tr.  203;  GE  5  at  2;  GE  6  at  4;  AE  M)  On  March  4,  2008, \\nApplicant’s  counsel  disclosed  to  the  FBI  that  Applicant  deleted  the  Company  D \\nproprietary files because Company L had requested the computers. (AE B at 2-3)  \\n\\n \\nAfter receipt of the first two computers, the Naval Criminal Investigative Service \\n(NCIS)  and  FBI  wanted  to  check  a  laptop  computer  and  a  desk  top  computer  in \\nApplicant’s  possession  for  spillage.  NCIS  requested  the  two  computers  in  February \\n2008. (Tr. 141; AE B) Applicant had saved tax returns and other personal information on \\nthe  desktop  computer.  The  desk  top  computer  was  obsolete  and  lacked  sufficient \\ncomputer  power  to  run  simulations,  and  Applicant  believed  it  had  no  risk  of  having \\nclassified data on it. (Tr. 210) Applicant’s attorney wanted to find out whether the two \\ncomputers were owned by Applicant, Company D, or DOD before providing them to the \\nFBI  or  NCIS.  (Tr.  141)  With  the  assistance  of  Company  D,  Applicant’s  attorney \\ndetermined  the  two  computers  were  probably  owned  by  DOD.  On  March  4,  2008, \\nApplicant’s  attorney  wrote  the  FBI  volunteering  to  have  Applicant  provide  the  two \\n\\n \\n5 \\n                                         \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "computers to the FBI. (Tr. 143-147, 164-165, 226; AE B; AE H) The FBI did not allege \\nthat  there  were  deletions  from  the  two  computers  Applicant  provided  in  March  2008; \\nhowever, Applicant said the Company D proprietary information that he did not want to \\nrelease to Company L was on the second set of computers provided to NCIS and the \\nFBI. (Tr. 228-230) Applicant deleted the Company D proprietary information. (Tr. 228-\\n232) Applicant’s attorney disclosed to the FBI that she had retained a copy of the hard \\ndrive of the desktop computer in her office safe. (Tr. 144; AE B) The FBI never asked \\nfor the copy of the hard drive. (Tr. 144-145) There is no evidence that the FBI found any \\nclassified information on the two computers provided on March 4, 2008. (Tr. 172)       \\n\\n \\nInvestigators checked some of the computers used in the project; however, they \\ndid  not  check  all  of the  other  computers  used  on the project  that  logically  might  also \\nhave spillage. (Tr. 79, 81, 88-89) C assumed that Company L was out to get Applicant \\nbecause  of  how  he  was  targeted  by  the  investigation.  (Tr.  82-83)  The  FBI  did  not \\ninterview C. (Tr. 80) \\n\\n \\nOn August 19, 2010, Applicant and his counsel met with an AUSA and others for \\na proffer session. (Tr. 149) Applicant advised the FBI that Applicant had compact discs \\nthat he  received from  Company  L  with  trusted  downloads for  testing  simulations.  (Tr. \\n156-159,  210,  212)  The  discs  were  marked  unclassified.  (Tr.  210)  Applicant  also \\ndisclosed  he  had  the  flash  drive  that  contained  the  C-file  that  he  downloaded  on  his \\ncomputer in December 2007. (Tr. 222) He had previously deleted the C-file off of the \\nflash drive. (Tr. 224) On August 23, 2010, Applicant provided the requested compact \\ndiscs and flash drive to the NCIS. (Tr. 159, 170, 222; AE H)  \\n\\n \\nAt  the  August  19,  2010  proffer,  AUSA,  an  FBI  special  agent,  and  two  NCIS \\nspecial agents asked Applicant numerous questions about the computers, project, and \\nclassified  data.  (Tr.  150;  AE  C)  The  forensic  examination  determined  that  classified \\nmaterials had been stored on one of the laptop computers. FBI SMEs, who were not \\nrelated to Applicant’s team, reviewed the “classified values” and concluded 11 values \\nwere not sufficiently scrambled to render them unclassified. (Tr. 213; GE 3; GE 5 at 3; \\nAE P) The classification level was deemed to be confidential. (AE L; AE P) Applicant \\nbelieved the FBI SMEs erred in the manner that some of the numbers were “reverse \\nengineered”  and  classified  as  confidential  or  secret.  (GE  6  at  5)  The  FBI  had  been \\nrelying  on  erroneous  information  from  SMEs,  and  the  FBI  SMEs  had  mistakenly \\nconfused some of the unclassified testing numbers with classified data. (Tr. 151, 154, \\n211; GE 3) Applicant agreed with the FBI that one table contained classified numbers. \\n(Tr.  151-154;  GE  5  at  2-3)  Applicant  conceded  his  unclassified  computer  should  not \\nhave  been  used  for  classified  information  because  it  did  not  contain  the  security \\nmeasures required for storage of classified material. (Tr. 155-156)  \\n\\n \\nThe AUSA appeared to accept that Applicant was involved in an inadvertent spill \\nof  classified  numbers  as  opposed  to  a  deliberate  attempt  to  compromise  classified \\ninformation. (Tr. 152) On December 16, 2010, an FBI special agent wrote the Defense \\nIndustrial  Security  Clearance  Office  (DISCO)  about  the  investigation  of  Applicant  for \\nunauthorized  removal  and  retention  of  classified  documents  or  material  in  possible \\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 1924. (GE 3) The FBI letter advised that no charges would be \\n\\n \\n6 \\n                                         \\n \\n\\n\n",

(Tr.  135-136)  She \\nrecommended reinstatement of Applicant’s security clearance.     \\n \\n\\nto  cooperate  with \\n\\nthe \\n\\nPolicies \\n\\n  \\n\\nThe  U.S.  Supreme  Court  has  recognized  the  substantial  discretion  of  the \\nExecutive  Branch  in  regulating  access  to  information  pertaining  to  national  security \\nemphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. \\nEgan,  484  U.S.  518,  528  (1988).  As  Commander  in  Chief,  the  President  has  the \\nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \\nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. \\nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \\napplicant’s  eligibility  for  access  to  classified  information  “only  upon  a  finding  that  it  is \\nclearly  consistent  with  the  national  interest  to  do  so.”  Exec.  Or.  10865,  Safeguarding \\nClassified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  \\n \\n\\nEligibility  for  a  security  clearance  is  predicated  upon  the  applicant  meeting  the \\ncriteria  contained  in  the  revised  adjudicative  guidelines.  These  guidelines  are  not \\ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \\nguidelines  are  applied  in  conjunction  with  an  evaluation  of  the  whole  person.  An \\nadministrative \\nimpartial,  and \\ncommonsense  decision.  An  administrative  judge  must  consider  all  available,  reliable \\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \\n\\njudge’s  overarching  adjudicative  goal \\n\\n  \\nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \\naccess  to  classified  information.  This  relationship  transcends  normal  duty  hours  and \\nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \\npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \\nabout  potential,  rather  than  actual,  risk  of  compromise  of  classified  information. \\nClearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \\n\\nis  a \\n\\nfair, \\n\\n \\n8 \\n                                         \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. \\nThis decision is not based, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination \\nabout applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. Thus, any decision to deny a security \\nclearance  is  merely  an  indication  the  applicant  has  not  met  the  strict  guidelines  the \\nPresident and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  \\n\\n \\n \\nInitially,  the  Government  must  establish,  by  substantial  evidence,  conditions  in \\nthe  personal  or  professional  history  of  the  applicant  that  may  disqualify  the  applicant \\nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \\nof  establishing  controverted  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  See  Egan,  484  U.S.  at  531. \\n“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. \\nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \\npresume  a  nexus  or  rational  connection  between  proven  conduct  under  any  of  the \\ncriteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \\nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \\n \\n\\nOnce  the  Government  establishes  a  disqualifying  condition  by  substantial \\nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \\nfacts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \\nis  clearly  consistent  with  the  national  interest  to  grant  or  continue  his  security \\nclearance.”  ISCR  Case  No.  01-20700  at  3  (App.  Bd.  Dec.  19,  2002).  The  burden  of \\ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. \\n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \\nif they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).  \\n \\n\\nAnalysis \\n\\n \\nPersonal Conduct \\n \\n\\nAG ¶ 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \\n \\nConduct  involving  questionable  judgment,  lack  of  candor,  dishonesty,  or \\nunwillingness  to  comply  with  rules  and  regulations  can  raise  questions \\nabout  an  individual's  reliability,  trustworthiness  and  ability  to  protect \\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \\nand  candid  answers  during  the  security  clearance  process  or  any  other \\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \\n \\nTwo  personal  conduct  disqualifying  conditions  under  AG  ¶  16  are  potentially \\n\\napplicable. Those two disqualifying conditions provide:   \\n\\n \\n(d)  credible  adverse  information  that  is  not  explicitly  covered  under  any \\nother  guideline  and  may  not  be  sufficient  by  itself  for  an  adverse \\ndetermination,  but  which,  when  combined  with  all  available  information \\nsupports  a  whole-person  assessment  of  questionable \\njudgment, \\nuntrustworthiness,  unreliability,  lack  of  candor,  unwillingness  to  comply \\nwith  rules  and  regulations,  or  other  characteristics  indicating  that  the \\n\\n \\n9 \\n                                         \\n \\n\\n\n",

Applicant violated rules in December 2007 when he \\ndiscovered that he had downloaded possible classified information onto B’s computer \\nand his own computer, and he failed to report this security breach to his FSO (SOR ¶ \\n1.a).  \\n\\n \\nApplicant refuted the SOR allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.b through 1.e. SOR ¶ 1.b. On \\nJanuary  28,  2008,  Company  D  asked  Applicant  to  return  two  computers;  however, \\nCompany D did not indicate it was necessary to return the computers that day. One of \\nthe computers was at Applicant’s home, and he had other errands to complete that day. \\nApplicant provided the computers the next morning. He had a deletion program running \\non one of the computers. No rules were violated.  \\n\\n \\nSOR  ¶  1.c.  The  hard  drive  of  one  of  Applicant’s  computers  was  restricted  to \\nunclassified information use, and it was found to contain some classified data. Applicant \\nwas  unaware  his  computer  contained  classified  information.  He  is not  responsible for \\n“trusted  downloads,”  and  he  inadvertently  downloaded  classified  information  from  a \\ntrusted  download  onto  his  hard  drive.  In  February  2008,  he  reported  this  breach  to \\nCompany D’s FSO. He did not knowingly violate any rules. \\n\\n \\nSOR ¶ 1.d. On March 4, 2008, Applicant’s attorney wrote the FBI that Applicant \\nwas willing to cooperate with the investigation. On August 19, 2010, during the AUSA \\nproffer,  Applicant  mentioned  he  had  compact  discs  and  a  flash  drive  from  trusted \\ndownloads. Applicant did not believe they contained classified information. On August \\n23, 2010, Applicant provided the compact discs and flash drive. There is no information \\nthat they contained classified information.   \\n\\n \\nSOR ¶ 1.e alleges Applicant had two computers that he provided to his attorney, \\nand his attorney retained them as of December 2010. Applicant had four computers that \\nwere  requested  by  Company  D.  Two  were  requested  on  January  28,  2008,  and  he \\nturned two of them into Company D on January 29, 2008. In February 2008, the NCIS \\nand FBI requested two more computers. Applicant’s attorney wanted to find out whether \\nthe  two  computers  were  owned  by  Applicant,  Company  D,  or  DOD  before  providing \\nthem  to  the  FBI  or  NCIS.  On  March  4,  2008,  Applicant’s  attorney  wrote  the  FBI \\nvolunteering to have Applicant provide the two computers to the FBI.

       "Further analysis concerning applicability of mitigating conditions is required. The \\nAppeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving the applicability \\nof mitigating conditions as follows:  \\n\\n \\nOnce  a  concern  arises  regarding  an  Applicant’s  security  clearance \\neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \\nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \\nCir.  1990),  cert.  denied,  499  U.S.  905  (1991).  After  the  Government \\npresents  evidence  raising  security  concerns,  the  burden  shifts  to  the \\napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The \\nstandard  applicable  in  security  clearance  decisions  is  that  articulated  in \\nEgan,  supra.  “Any  doubt  concerning  personnel  being  considered  for \\naccess  to  classified  information  will  be  resolved  in  favor  of  the  national \\nsecurity.” Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b).  \\n \\n\\nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  \\n\\n \\nThree mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 17 are potentially applicable:  \\n \\n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \\nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \\nunlikely  to  recur  and  does  not  cast  doubt  on  the  individual's  reliability, \\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \\n \\n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \\nto  change  the  behavior  or  taken  other  positive  steps  to  alleviate  the \\nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \\nor  other  inappropriate  behavior,  and  such  behavior  is  unlikely  to  recur;  \\nand \\n \\n(e)  the  individual  has  taken  positive  steps  to  reduce  or  eliminate \\nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \\n \\nAG ¶ 16(e) is mitigated by AG ¶ 17(e) because Applicant has fully disclosed his \\nrule violations. Law enforcement, security officials, and his witnesses are well aware of \\nhis  security-related  conduct,  and he  is not  vulnerable  to  exploitation, manipulation,  or \\nduress because of his security-related conduct. \\n\\n \\nAG ¶¶ 17(c) and 17(d) apply. The only evidence of Applicant’s December 2007 \\nsecurity breach was Applicant’s self-report; however, his self-report was not timely, as it \\nappears  it  was  disclosed  at  his  August  19,  2010  AUSA  proffer.  However,  Applicant’s \\nfailure to report the December 2007 security breach is not recent; the security breach \\nwas  inadvertent;  “it  happened  under  such  unique  circumstances  that  it  is  unlikely  to \\nrecur;”  and  it  “does  not  cast  doubt  on  Applicant’s  reliability,  trustworthiness,  or  good \\njudgment.”  He  admitted  that  he  showed  poor  judgment  in  December  2007  when  he \\ndiscovered that he had downloaded possible classified information onto B’s computer \\nand his own computer, and he failed to report this security breach to his FSO (SOR ¶ \\n\\n \\n11 \\n                                         \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "1.a).  Security  needed  to  assess  the  scope  of  the  breach  of  security  or  spillage,  and \\nsecurity was unable to check other computers and determine who was responsible for \\nthe “trusted download” that caused the security breach.  \\n\\n \\nApplicant  understands  the  importance  of  informing  security  of  any  security \\nbreach or possible security breach, and I am confident he will timely disclosed required \\ninformation. Personal conduct concerns are mitigated. Even if security concerns are not \\nmitigated under Guideline E, they are mitigated under the whole-person concept, infra. \\n \\nHandling Protected Information  \\n \\n  \\nAG  ¶  33  articulates  the  security  concern  relating  to  handling  protected \\ninformation  as  follows,  “Deliberate  or  negligent  failure  to  comply  with  rules  and \\nregulations for protecting classified or other sensitive information raises doubt about an \\nindividual’s trustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or willingness and ability to safeguard \\nsuch information, and is a serious security concern.” \\n\\n \\nAG  ¶  34  provides  three  disqualifying  conditions  that  could  raise  a  security \\n\\n  \\nconcern and may be disqualifying in this case:  \\n \\n\\n(b) collecting or storing classified or other protected information at home or \\nin any other unauthorized location; \\n \\n(c) loading, drafting, editing, modifying, storing, transmitting, or otherwise \\nhandling classified reports, data, or other information on any unapproved \\nequipment including but not limited to any typewriter, word processor, or \\ncomputer  hardware,  software,  drive,  system,  gameboard,  handheld, \\n\"palm\" or pocket device or other adjunct equipment; and \\n \\n(g) any failure to comply with rules for the protection of classified or other \\nsensitive information. \\n\\n \\n\\nAG ¶¶ 34(b), 34(c), and 34(g) apply. These three disqualifying conditions do not \\ninclude  a  requirement  that  Applicant  knew  he  was  downloading  classified  information \\nonto  an  unclassified  system,  and  they  do  not  require  that  he  be  aware  that  his \\nunclassified computer systems contain classified information.  \\n\\n \\nSOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.c discussed previously are cross-alleged under SOR ¶¶ 2.a \\nand  2.c.  In  December  2007,  Applicant  discovered  that  he  had  downloaded  possible \\nclassified  information  onto  B’s  computer  and  his  own  computer.  The  two  computers \\nwere not authorized for storage of classified information.   \\n\\n \\nThe hard drive of one of Applicant’s DOD-issued laptop computers was restricted \\nto unclassified information use, and a forensic evaluation and SME review found that his \\nlaptop computer contained some data classified at the confidential level. Applicant was \\nunaware  this  computer  contained  classified  information.  He  is  not  responsible  for \\n\\n \\n12 \\n                                         \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "“trusted  downloads,”  and  he  inadvertently  downloaded  classified  information  from  a \\ntrusted download onto his hard drive.  \\n\\n \\nThree mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 35 are potentially applicable:  \\n\\n \\n\\n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior, or it has happened so \\ninfrequently  or  under  such  unusual  circumstances,  that  it  is  unlikely  to \\nrecur  and  does  not  cast  doubt  on  the  individual's  current  reliability, \\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \\n \\n(b) the individual responded favorably to counseling or remedial security \\ntraining and now demonstrates a positive attitude toward the discharge of \\nsecurity responsibilities; and \\n \\n(c) the security violations were due to improper or inadequate training. \\n  \\nAG ¶¶ 35(a) through 35(c) apply. As indicated in the previous section, AG ¶ 35(a) \\nis  established.  The  particular  simulation  program  involving  inadvertent  transfers  of \\nclassified data to unclassified systems was changed to a completely classified system. \\nSuch  erroneous  “trusted  downloads”  will  not  recur.  Applicant  understands  how \\nimportant it is to avoid future transfers of classified information to unclassified computer \\nsystems.  He  has  been  counseled  and  understands  that  when  a  security  violation  is \\ndiscovered, it should be timely reported to his FSO. He has a positive attitude towards \\nconscientiously complying with security requirements.  \\n\\n \\nApplicant’s  actions  since  March  2008  show  sufficient  effort,  good  judgment, \\n  \\ntrustworthiness,  and  reliability  to  warrant  mitigation  of  handling  protected  information \\nsecurity  concerns.  Even  if  handling  protected  information  concerns  are  not  mitigated \\nunder Guideline K, they are mitigated under the whole-person concept, infra.    \\n\\n \\n\\nWhole-Person Concept \\n\\n \\n Under  the  whole-person  concept,  the  administrative  judge  must  evaluate  an \\nApplicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s \\nconduct  and all  the  circumstances. The  administrative  judge  should  consider  the nine \\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  \\n\\nthe  conduct, \\n\\nthe  nature,  extent,  and  seriousness  of \\nto \\n\\nthe  conduct;  (2) \\nthe \\n(1) \\ncircumstances  surrounding \\ninclude  knowledgeable \\nparticipation;  (3)  the  frequency  and  recency  of  the  conduct;  (4)  the \\nindividual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \\nwhich  participation \\nthe  presence  or  absence  of \\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \\nfor  the  conduct;  (8)  the  potential  for  pressure,  coercion,  exploitation,  or \\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \\n\\nis  voluntary;  (6) \\n\\n \\n13 \\n                                         \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "Under  AG  ¶  2(c),  the  ultimate  determination  of  whether  to  grant  eligibility  for  a \\nsecurity  clearance  must  be  an  overall  commonsense  judgment  based  upon  careful \\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \\ncomments under Guidelines E and K in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors \\nin AG ¶ 2(a)  were addressed under Guidelines  E and K, but some warrant additional \\ncomment. \\n\\n  \\nApplicant is a 56-year-old software engineer employed by Company D from 1980 \\nto 2007. From 2008 to present, he has been employed by another defense contractor. \\nHis spouse is a security clearance holder; his father was a career Navy officer; his two \\nolder brothers served in the Navy; and his nephew was a Navy Seal, who served three \\ntours  in  Afghanistan.  In  1982,  Applicant  received  a  bachelor  of  science  degree  in \\nmathematics.  During  Desert  Shield,  Applicant  was  deployed  for  six  months  to  the \\nPersian Gulf aboard a U.S. Navy vessel.   \\n\\n \\nA Navy captain, who has known Applicant since the late 1990s; a high-level DOD \\nemployee, who has oversight authority over about 9,000 of DOD employees and a $300 \\nmillion budget and who has known Applicant since the 1990s; a program director on a \\nproject,  who  has  known  Applicant  since  2003;  two  contractors,  who  worked  with \\nApplicant  on  the  project  at  issue;  and  Applicant’s  attorney  described  Applicant  in \\nlaudatory  terms.  Applicant  is  an  “incredibly  gifted,”  exceptionally  creative,  and \\n“incredibly skilled” technician and engineer. He is diligent, intelligent, professional, open, \\ncandid, honest, and conscientious about the protection of classified information. Most of \\nhis  character  witnesses  were  aware  of  the  SOR  allegations,  had  read  Applicant’s \\nstatements in 2011 and 2013, and recommended reinstatement of Applicant’s security \\nclearance.  \\n\\n \\nApplicant’s  SOR  allegations  relate  to  his  handling  of  confidential  information  in \\nDecember  2007  and  January  2008  and  participation  in  the  follow-up  investigation  in \\n2009  and  2010.  Company  L  or  Navy  employees  provided  “trusted  downloads”  to \\nApplicant and his team. The trusted downloads were not supposed to contain classified \\ndata or software; however, there was some classified data mixed in with the unclassified \\ndata. Applicant and other members of his team unknowingly downloaded the classified \\nand  unclassified  information  onto  computers  allocated  to  unclassified  information. \\nApplicant  did  not  compromise  classified  information  as  there  is  no  evidence  the \\nunclassified  computers  were  used  by  anyone  not  authorized  to  review  the  classified \\ninformation. In December 2007, Applicant discovered possible classified information on \\nhis unclassified computer and on B’s computer. B and Applicant agreed that they should \\ndelete  it,  and  they  did  so.  This  error  was  aggravated  when  Applicant  and  B  failed  to \\ndisclose the discovery of the probable classified information on the flash drive and their \\ncomputers  to  their  FSOs.  Applicant  did  not  receive  adequate  training  or  supervision \\nfrom  B,  a  GS-13  Navy  employee  on  this  occasion.  There  was  no  evidence  that \\nApplicant was told prior to December 2007 of the protocol after discovery of possible \\nclassified information on an unclassified computer.  \\n\\n \\nAfter  two  of  Applicant’s  assigned  DOD-issued  computers  were  requested,  he \\ndeleted Company D proprietary information and personal information before providing \\n\\n \\n14 \\n                                         \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "one  computer  to  Company  D  and  one  computer to  NCIS. These deletions  raised  the \\npossibility  that  he  was  intentionally  obstructing  the  investigation  because  forensic \\nexamination revealed there were deletions, but could not determine the content of the \\ndeletions.  Applicant  provided  the  only  evidence  of  the  content  of  the  deletions.  In \\nFebruary  2008,  after  Applicant  made  the  deletions,  he  hired  an  experienced  national \\nsecurity attorney who advised him to cooperate with the investigation. After March 2008, \\nApplicant  cooperated  with  the  investigation,  and  his  attorney  notified  the  FBI  that  he \\nwould assist the investigation. His errors in judgment were made from December 2007 \\nthrough February 2008 and are not recent.   \\n\\n \\nApplicant’s hearing statement was credible. He understands what he needs to do \\nto maintain his eligibility for access to classified information. He has avoided any hint of \\nviolation  of  his  employer’s  rules  or  security  rules  after  March  2008.  He  expressed \\nsincere remorse for his infractions of security rules and errors in judgment in December \\n2007  and  January  2008,  and  he  emphasized  his  determination  to  conscientiously \\ncomply  with  all  security  rules  and  requirements.  I  am  confident  he  will  continue  to \\nconscientiously exercise his security responsibilities in the future. \\n\\n    \\nI  have  carefully  applied  the  law,  as  set  forth  in  Egan,  Exec.  Or.  10865,  the \\nDirective,  and  the  AGs,  to  the  facts  and  circumstances  in  the  context  of  the  whole \\nperson.

Applicant  did  not  respond  to  the  FORM.  I  was \\nassigned the case on December 1, 2015.

He was divorced in 1998 \\n                                                           \\n1 The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \\nSecurity  Clearance  Review  Program  (January  2,  1992),  as  amended  (Directive);  and  the  adjudicative \\nguidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on September 1, 2006. \\n\\n1 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\n",
       "and is now estranged from a subsequent spouse. Facts about this estranged female are \\nunclear,  although  it  appears  she  is  from  Russia,  where  she  currently  resides  with  or \\nnear  family.  He  provided  incomplete  information  on  his  security  clearance  application \\n(SCA)  about  his  family  and  children.  Other  discrepancies  appear  throughout  his \\ninvestigatory record. Applicant presently lives in another country with a female foreign \\nnational  in  order  to  reduce  the  costs  he  would  otherwise  expend  living  in  the  United \\nStates while awaiting a return to work.  \\n \\n \\nAt issue in the SOR are the following facts: Applicant has a wife who is a citizen \\nand resident of Russia.2 They are estranged, but Applicant has no plans to divorce his \\nforeign  wife  because  he  no  longer  believes  in  divorce.  He  has  a  daughter  who  is  a \\ncitizen  of  the  United  States  and  is  currently  a  resident  of  Russia,  where  she  is  a \\nuniversity student. He also has parents-in-law who are citizens and residents of Russia. \\nApplicant met them in about July 1998 on a visit to their home. He again saw them on a \\nsubsequent  trip  to  Russia  with  his  wife.  He  has  had  no  other  contact  with  them  and \\ndoes not know how often his estranged wife currently has with her parents now that all \\nthree  are  in  Russia.  His  father-in-law  and  mother-in-law  are  a  teacher  and  a \\ngynecologist,  respectively.  Applicant  assumed  they  were  Communists  because  the \\nCommunists were in power when he met them. As of 2015, Russia is one of the two \\nleading state intelligence threats to United States interests, based on their capabilities, \\nintent,  and  broad  operational  scopes.3  Applicant  admits  the  Guideline  B  SOR \\nallegations, but did not address them in any manner in his SOR Response.     \\n \\n \\nIn completing SCAs in both August 3, 2009, and March 23, 2013, Applicant failed \\nto  list  multiple  names  he  has  used,  places  of  former  residence,  periods  of \\nunemployment, relatives, and foreign contacts. He told an investigator in 2010 that he \\nhad no problems while working with a particular employer, but later conceded he was \\ninvolved in a harassment suit while working there. Despite a 2010 claim to the contrary, \\nhe failed in 2007 to file an appropriate contact with foreign nationals report regarding the \\nforeign woman with whom he currently cohabitates. Applicant admits these allegations.  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\nPolicies \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nWhen  evaluating  an  applicant’s  suitability \\n\\n \\n \\nthe \\nadministrative  judge  must  consider  the  adjudicative  guidelines.  In  addition  to  brief \\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \\ndisqualifying  conditions  and  mitigating  conditions,  which  are  used  in  evaluating  an \\napplicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. \\n \\n\\nfor  a  security  clearance, \\n\\nThese  guidelines  are  not  inflexible  rules  of  law.  Instead,  recognizing  the \\ncomplexities  of  human  behavior,  these  guidelines  are  applied  in  conjunction  with  the \\n                                                           \\n2  In  some  records  within  the  FORM,  Applicant  indicated  that  his  estranged  wife  became  a  naturalized \\ncitizen in 2007 or 2008 and now resides in the United States, but the discrepancies are never resolved. \\n(See FORM, Item 6) \\n \\n3 FORM, Item 9, at 3. \\n\\n2 \\n\\n\n",
       "factors  listed  in  the  adjudicative  process.  The  administrative  judge’s  overarching \\nadjudicative  goal  is  a  fair,  impartial,  and  commonsense  decision.  According  to  AG  ¶ \\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \\nthe  “whole-person  concept.”  The  administrative  judge  must  consider  all  available, \\nreliable information about the person in making a decision. \\n\\n \\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) \\nrequires  that  “[a]ny  doubt  concerning  personnel  being  considered  for  access  to \\nclassified  information  will  be  resolved  in  favor  of  national  security.”  In  reaching  this \\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \\non the evidence contained in the record.  \\n\\n \\nUnder Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \\ncontroverted  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  Under  Directive  ¶  E3.1.15,  an  “applicant  is \\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \\nmitigate  facts  admitted  by  applicant  or  proven  by  Department  Counsel  and  has  the \\nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.”  \\n\\nthe  Government  predicated  upon \\n\\n \\nA  person  who  seeks  access  to  classified  information  enters  into  a  fiduciary \\nrelationship  with \\ntrust  and  confidence.  This \\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \\nGovernment  reposes  a  high  degree  of  trust  and  confidence  in  individuals  to  whom  it \\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \\nthe  possible  risk  the  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  safeguard \\nclassified information. Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall \\nbe “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \\nloyalty of the applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b).  \\n\\nThe security concern relating to the Guideline B is set out in AG ¶ 6: \\n\\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \\nany  foreign  interest.  Adjudication  under  this  Guideline  can  and  should \\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \\nfinancial \\nto,  such \\nconsiderations  as  whether  the  foreign  country  is  known  to  target  United \\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \\nrisk of terrorism. \\n\\nincluding,  but  not \\n\\nlocated, \\n\\ninterest \\n\\nlimited \\n\\nis \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n3 \\n\\nAnalysis \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\n",
       "Applicant remains married to the female of Russian origin at issue. Therefore, it \\ncan be assumed he maintains some level of affection for this woman, the mother of his \\nchild. It can also be assumed he maintains a bond or ties of affection for their child, who \\nis  now  studying  at  a  Russian  college.  As  for  his  in-laws,  while  their  contact  with \\nApplicant is negligible, it can be assumed his estranged partner has ties of affection with \\nher own parents. Those ties are routinely attributed to the spouse (Applicant) in these \\ncases. Given these facts, disqualifying conditions AG ¶¶ 7(a) and (b) apply:  \\n \\n\\nto  protect  sensitive \\n\\nAG ¶ 7(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \\nassociate,  friend,  or  other  person  who  is  a  citizen  of  or  resident  in  a \\nforeign  country  if  that  contact  creates  a  heightened  risk  of  foreign \\nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \\n \\nAG ¶ 7(b) connection to a foreign person, group, government, or country \\nthat  create  a  potential  conflict  of  interest  between  the  individual’s \\nobligation \\nthe \\nindividual’s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \\nthat information. \\n \\nIn  finding  disqualifying  conditions  applicable,  I  specifically  note  that  AG  ¶  7(a) \\nrequires substantial evidence of a heightened risk. The heightened risk required to raise \\na  disqualifying  condition  is  a  relatively  low  standard.  Heightened  risk  denotes  a  risk \\ngreater than the normal risk inherent in having a family member living under a foreign \\ngovernment or substantial assets in a foreign nation. Russia is one of the two leading \\nstate intelligence threats to United States interests. In addition, foreign family ties can \\npose a security risk even without a connection to a foreign government. This is because \\nan applicant may be subject to coercion or undue influence when a third party pressures \\nor  threatens  an  applicant’s family  members.  Under  these facts,  while  unlikely,  a  third \\nparty  coercion  concern  potentially  exists  in  Russia.  Therefore,  there  is  sufficient \\nevidence to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \\n\\ninformation  or \\n\\ntechnology  and \\n\\n  \\nAG ¶ 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \\n\\nof the mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 8, and find the following are relevant: \\n \\n\\nAG ¶ 8(a) the nature of the relationship with foreign persons, the country in \\nwhich  these  persons  are  located,  or  the  positions  or  activities  of  those \\npersons  in  that  country  are  such  that  it  is  unlikely  the  individual  will  be \\nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \\nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.; \\nand \\n\\n \\n\\nAG  ¶  8(b)  there  is  no  conflict  of  interest,  either  because  the  individual’s \\nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or \\ncountry  is  so  minimal,  or  the  individual  has  such  deep  and  longstanding \\nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to \\nresolve any conflict of interests in favor of the U.S. interests.  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n4 \\n\\n\n",
       "The mere possession of close family ties to persons in a foreign country is not, \\nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in \\na foreign country and an applicant has frequent, non-casual contacts with that relative, \\nthis  factor  alone  is  sufficient  to  create  the  potential  for  foreign  influence  and  could \\npotentially result in the compromise of classified information.  \\n\\n \\nHere,  Applicant  provided  scant  information about  his estranged  wife,  daughter, \\nand  in-laws.  Indeed,  information  about  his  in-laws  is  more  abundant  than  information \\nabout his child and her mother. While his personal ties to his in-laws may be weak, their \\nimpact on Applicant cannot be discerned without more information about his wife and \\nchild. Under these limited facts, no mitigating conditions weigh in Applicant’s favor. \\n\\nThe  security  concern  for  personal  conduct  is  set  out  in  AG  ¶  15,  where  the \\nsignificance of conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \\nunwillingness  to  comply  with  rules  and  regulations  is  defined  ([p]ersonal  conduct  can \\nraise  questions  about  an  individual’s  reliability,  trustworthiness  and  ability  to  protect \\nclassified  information).  Of  special  interest  is  any  failure to  provide  truthful and  candid \\nanswers during the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the \\nsecurity clearance process.  \\n\\n \\nIn completing his 2009 and 2013 SCAs, Applicant’s answers in many areas were \\neither deficient or in conflict. His answers in a 2010 interview were either intentionally or \\nnegligently incomplete  with regard to past  workplace problems and the reporting of a \\nforeign  cohabitant  to  his  former  employer.  If  these  inaccuracies  were  intentionally \\nincorrect, such facts could give rise to:  \\n\\n \\nAG  ¶  16(a)  deliberate  omission,  concealment,  or  falsification  of  relevant \\nfacts \\nfrom  any  personnel  security  questionnaire,  personal  history \\nstatement,  or  similar  form  used  to  conduct  investigations,  determine \\nemployment  qualifications,  award  benefits  or  status,  determine  security \\nclearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities, \\nand  \\n \\nAG  ¶  16(b)  deliberately  providing \\ninformation \\nconcerning  relevant  facts  to  an  employer,  investigator,  security  official, \\ncompetent medical authority, or other official government representative. \\n \\nApplicant admitted all three allegations raised under Guideline E and provided no \\nexplanations or commentary. While his admission to the SCA discrepancies could be \\ndiscounted and his discrepancies found to be the product of negligence, this guideline \\ncould  be  found  in  his  favor.  In  admitting  allegations  that  he  knowingly  withheld \\ninformation and denied having had problems while employed at a place where he was \\ninvolved in a harassment suit, however, the facts tend to indicate that these answers – \\nwithout  more  –  were  intentionally  false  or  misleading.  This  is  particularly  true  in  the \\n5 \\n\\nfalse  or  misleading \\n\\n \\n\\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "absence  of  some  explanation  claiming  forgetfulness  or  another  basis  for  having \\nprovided a negligently entered SCA answer.

Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) \\nwere addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment.  \\n \\n \\nApplicant failed to do more than admit the allegations raised in the SOR. He then \\nrequested a judgment based on the written record.

This is simply the result of \\na  deficiently  supplemented  record.

       "On  July  26,  2014,  Applicant  answered  the  SOR,  admitted  all  the  SOR  allegations, \\nwaived  his  right  to  a  hearing,  and  elected  to  have  his  case  decided  on  the  written \\nrecord.2  \\n \\n \\nOn  July  22,  2015,  Department  Counsel  prepared  a  file  of  relevant  material \\n(FORM) and sent it to Applicant. The FORM contains the SOR, Applicant’s answer, and \\nresponses to two interrogatories, which were admitted into the record as Exhibits 1 – 4. \\nDepartment Counsel also submitted with the FORM a request for administrative notice, \\nExhibit (Ex.) 5, which is discussed below.  \\n \\n \\nprovided 30 days from its receipt to file a response, but did not submit one. \\n \\n \\nOn December 1, 2015, I was assigned Applicant’s case and provided a copy of \\nthe  FORM.  On  my  own  motion,  I  opened  the  record  to  provide  him  a  last  chance \\nopportunity  to  submit  a  response  to  the  FORM.  He  was  also  advised  of  the  serious \\nsecurity concerns raised by his possession of a current foreign passport and that such \\nconcerns may be mitigated by surrendering or relinquishing the passport as set forth in \\nthe Directive.4 Applicant did not submit a response or provide additional documentation. \\nThe record closed on December 15, 2015. \\n \\n\\nOn  August  31,  2015,  Applicant  acknowledged  receipt  of  the  FORM.3  He  was \\n\\nAdministrative Notice: The Russian Federation (Russia) \\n\\nDOHA  administrative \\n\\njudges  may  accept \\n\\n \\n \\nfor  administrative  notice \\nuncontroverted,  easily  verifiable  facts  regarding  a  foreign  country  from  official  U.S. \\nGovernment reports. Additionally, the official position of relevant federal agencies or the \\npertinent statements of key U.S. Government officials regarding a foreign country may \\nbe appropriate for administrative notice. The party requesting administrative notice of a \\nparticular matter must provide the source document, either the pertinent parts or the full \\ndocument,  to  allow  the  judge  and,  if  necessary,  the  Appeal  Board  to  assess  the \\nreliability, accuracy, and relevancy of any administratively noticed fact. See generally, \\nISCR Case No. 08-09480 (App. Bd.

He received a commission \\nas an officer in Russia’s reserve military forces and worked for a time for the Russian \\nDefense Ministry. He immigrated to the United States in 1997 and married his wife, who \\nis also originally from Russia, in 2002. They have one child, who was born in the United \\nStates.  \\n \\n\\nApplicant  became  a  U.S.  citizen  in  2005.

Arguably,  Ex.  5  could  be  admitted  as  a  summary  of  the \\npertinent  facts  contained  in  the  source  documents.

However, based on the present record, I cannot find that Applicant’s failure to raise an objection to \\nEx. 5 amounts to an agreement as to the exhibits accuracy, reliability, and relevancy. Contrast with, ISCR \\nCase No. 14-03112 (App. Bd.

Individual  applicants  are  eligible  for  access  to \\nclassified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent  with  the  national \\ninterest” to authorize such access. E.O. 10865 § 2. \\n\\n \\nWhen  evaluating  an  applicant’s  eligibility \\n\\nfor  a  security  clearance,  an \\nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \\nintroductory  explanations,  the  guidelines  list  potentially  disqualifying  and  mitigating \\nconditions.  The  guidelines  are  not  inflexible  rules  of  law.  Instead,  recognizing  the \\ncomplexities  of  human  behavior,  an  administrative  judge  applies  the  guidelines  in  a  \\ncommonsense manner, considering all available and reliable information, in arriving at a \\nfair and impartial decision.  \\n\\n \\nDepartment  Counsel  must  present  evidence  to  establish  controverted  facts \\nalleged  in  the  SOR.

       "“security  clearance  determinations  should  err,  if  they  must,  on  the  side  of  denials.” \\nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \\n\\nthe  Government  predicated  upon \\n\\n \\nA  person  who  seeks  access  to  classified  information  enters  into  a  fiduciary \\n \\nrelationship  with \\ntrust  and  confidence.  This \\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of \\ntrust  and  confidence  in  individuals  to  whom  it  grants  access  to  classified  information. \\nDecisions  include,  by  necessity,  consideration  of  the  possible  risk  an  applicant  may \\ndeliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  safeguard  classified  information.  Such  decisions \\nentail  a  certain  degree  of  legally  permissible  extrapolation  of  potential,  rather  than \\nactual, risk of compromise of classified information. \\n \\n\\nClearance  decisions  must  be  made  “in  terms  of  the  national  interest  and  shall \\nin  no  sense  be  a  determination  as  to  the  loyalty  of  the  applicant  concerned.”  E.O. \\n10865 § 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance amounts to a finding that an \\napplicant,  at  the  time  the  decision  was  rendered,  did  not  meet  the  strict  guidelines \\nestablished for determining eligibility for access to classified information. \\n\\n \\n\\nAnalysis \\n\\n \\n\\nGuideline C, Foreign Preference  \\n \\n \\nUnder  AG  ¶  9,  the  foreign  preference  security  concern  arises  “[w]hen  an \\nindividual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the \\nUnited States.” Applicant actively exercised his foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. \\ncitizen,  including  voting  in  Russian  elections  and  renewing,  using,  and  maintaining  a \\nRussian passport. This record evidence raises the foreign preference security concern \\nand  establishes  the  disqualifying  condition  at  AG  ¶  10(a).10  The  foreign  preference \\nguideline also sets forth a number of potential mitigation conditions. I have considered \\nall the mitigating conditions and none apply. Notably, Applicant currently has a foreign \\npassport and is unwilling to relinquish or surrender it. A current or prospective clearance \\nholder  is  ineligible  for  a  security  clearance  unless  s/he  surrenders  it  to  the  cognizant \\nsecurity authority (CSA), invalidates the foreign passport, or receives approval from the \\nCSA for his/her continued possession and use of the foreign passport. See AG ¶¶ 11(d) \\nand  11(e).  Applicant  did  not  supply  any  information  that  any  of  the  preceding \\ncircumstances apply. Accordingly, foreign preference security concerns remain.  \\n \\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \\n \\n\\nThe foreign influence security concern is explained at AG ¶ 6:  \\n \\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \\n\\n                                                           \\n10 Exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen . . .

AG ¶ 2(b). \\n \\n \\nI  have  considered  all  the foreign  influence mitigating  conditions and,  based  on \\nthe  record  evidence,  none  apply.  Even  if  I  assume  for  the  sake  of  argument  that \\nApplicant’s property and non-familial connections in Russia are not significant enough to \\ncause  a  conflict  of  interest  with  his  security  obligations,  his  and  his  wife’s  close \\nrelationship to their family members in Russia raise a concern about his vulnerability or \\nsusceptibility to adverse foreign influence.

Applicant’s  familial  connections  in  Russia, \\ncoupled with the threat posed by the current Russian government to its own people and \\nthe security threat it poses to the United States, raises a heightened risk that Applicant \\ncould  be  subjected  to  adverse  foreign  influence.  Applicant  did  not  present  sufficient \\ninformation  to  mitigate  this  security  concern.  However,  this  adverse  finding  is  “not  a \\ncomment on Applicant’s patriotism but merely an acknowledgment that people may act \\nin unpredictable ways when faced with choices that could be important to a loved-one, \\nsuch as a family member.” ISCR Case No. 08-10025 at 4 (App. Bd.

       "The Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On\\nOctober 17, 2014, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\\ndecision–security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of\\nDefense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). Applicant  requested a hearing.\\nOn  November  21,  2015,  after  the  hearing,  Defense  Office  of  Hearings  and  Appeals  (DOHA)\\nAdministrative  Judge  Francisco  Mendez  denied  Applicant’s  request  for  a  security  clearance.\\nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive ¶¶ E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\\n\\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge’s adverse decision was\\n\\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\\n\\nThe Judge’s Findings of Fact\\n\\nThe Judge made the following findings pertinent to the issues raised on appeal.  Applicant\\nhas been continuously employed since 2004 and has held a clearance since 2008.  He owes the IRS\\nabout  $40,000  for  unpaid  taxes  from  tax  years  2005  through  2012  and  for  2014.1    Applicant\\nattributed his tax problems to his having spent funds on a wedding rather than his taxes, as well as\\nto inadequate withholding.  Over the past several years Applicant has entered into a number of\\ninstallment agreements with the IRS.  When he is unable to pay, he contacts the IRS and negotiates\\na new agreement.  Applicant has resolved other debts alleged in the SOR.  He has about $700 in\\ndiscretionary income each month.  His budget does not show any payments to the IRS.\\n\\nThe Judge’s Analysis\\n\\nThe Judge cleared Applicant of all SOR debts except those pertaining to his delinquent taxes.\\nHe noted that Applicant has been fully employed for many years but has consistently failed to pay\\nhis taxes in full.  The Judge noted that Applicant did not pay his 2014 taxes, which would have\\nbecome due after the receipt of the SOR.  The Judge concluded that not even the possible loss of a\\nsecurity clearance could motivate Applicant to change his financial habits.\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\nApplicant cites to evidence that he has resolved other SOR debts.  He also points to his latest\\nrepayment plan that, he argues, will enable him to resolve his tax delinquencies.  Applicant’s\\nargument is not sufficient to rebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the evidence in\\nthe record.  Neither is it sufficient to show that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was\\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-06093 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 4,\\n2015).  \\n\\n1The SOR alleged tax debts up through tax year 2011.  The Judge stated that he was considering the non-alleged\\n\\ndebts only in evaluating Applicant’s case for mitigation and the whole-person factors.  Decision at 3, note 7.  \\n\\n2\\n\\n\n",
       "Applicant requests an opportunity to present us with additional information about his budget,\\npayments to the IRS, and resolution of other debts.  His brief also refers to matters from outside the\\nrecord.  We are not able to consider new evidence on appeal.  Directive ¶ E3.1.29.  Applicant notes\\nthat the attorney who represented him at the hearing had requested the Judge not to consider several\\npages of the transcript due to a malfunction with the video-teleconference equipment.  The Judge\\nstated that he did not consider these pages.  Decision at 2, note 6.  Therefore, any technical problem\\nthat may have occurred did not impair Applicant’s receipt of due process.  \\n\\nThe Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the\\ndecision.  The decision is sustainable on this record.  “The general standard is that a clearance may\\nbe granted only when ‘clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.’”  Department\\nof the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).

The  SOR  alleged  security \\nconcerns under Guidelines E (Personal Conduct), B (Foreign Influence), and M (Use of \\nInformation  Technology  Systems),  and  detailed  reasons  why  the  DOD  adjudicators \\nwere  unable  to  find  that  it  is  clearly  consistent  with  the  national  interest  to  grant  or \\ncontinue  a  security  clearance  for  Applicant.  The  SOR  recommended  referral  to  an \\nadministrative  judge  to  determine  whether  a  clearance  should  be  granted,  continued, \\ndenied, or revoked.  \\n\\n \\n \\nApplicant  received  the  SOR  on  January  28,  2015.

The  transcript  (TR.)  was  received  on \\nNovember  25,  2015.  I  kept  the  record  open  to  enable  Applicant  to  supplement  it. \\nApplicant  took  advantage  of  that  opportunity.  He  timely  submitted  a  number  of \\ndocuments  which  were  marked  as  AE  J  and  K,  and  admitted  into  evidence  without \\nobjection.

       "Applicant  received  a  bachelor  of  arts  degree  in  Computer  Science  in  May  1981.7 \\nApplicant  was  married  in  August  1984,  separated  in  December  2009,  and  divorced  in \\nJuly  2010.  He  married  his  current  wife  in  October  2014.8  He  adopted  his  first  wife’s \\ndaughter (born in 1976) in the mid-1980’s.9 \\n\\nApplicant and his first wife started drifting apart and went through several years \\nfilled with marital issues leading up to their separation and actual divorce. She refused \\nto  attend  Applicant’s  father’s  funeral  in  1995,  his  mother’s  funeral  in  1999,  his  college \\nreunion, or his niece’s wedding in 2008. He claimed  it got to the point where he asked \\nher  to  help  him  with  something  and  she  refused.  He  experienced  a  difficult  residence \\nreconstruction  project.  There  was  a  lack  of  communication  between  Applicant  and  his \\nwife.  After  the  separation,  attempted  reconciliations  failed.  During  the  period  of  his \\nseparation,  an  employer’s  contract  ended  and  his  position  was  vacated.  He  searched \\nfor  a  new  position,  and  actually  obtained  several  short-term  ones.  During  the  period \\n2004 until 2013, 18 friends or relatives passed away. Applicant incurred several injuries, \\nillnesses,  and  conditions,  and  he  went  through  several  surgeries.

On  or  about  July  24,  2010,  Applicant  was \\nlooking through his personal e-mails on his government furnished equipment (GFE), a \\ncomputer,  and  accessed  some  online  dating  sites,  sports  sites,  and  book  sites. When \\nhe  opened  some  unsolicited  e-mails,  he  found  that  they  contained  photos  of  nude \\nwomen.  One  e-mail  contained  one  photo  of  five  nude  women  and  another  e-mail  had \\none  photo  which  he  considered  offensive,  but  did  not  describe.  He  claimed  that  if  he \\nhad  known  the  e-mails  contained  photos  of  nude  women,  he  would  not  have  opened \\nthem  on  his  office  GFE.  He  immediately  deleted  the  e-mails  after  conferring  with  a \\ncolleague.  Applicant  denied  that  he  ever  intentionally  used  his  GFE  to  look  at \\npornographic photos. This was the only time any of the e-mails he opened on his GFE \\ncontained photos of nude women. In addition, Applicant’s GFE computer screen saver \\nand  wall  paper  contained  approximately  eight  photos  of  his  scantly  clothed  girlfriend \\nwhich were not pornographic.11  \\n                                                           \\n \\n\\n7 GE 1, supra note 1, at 13; AE H (Diploma, dated May 23, 1981); AE F, supra note 4, at 1. \\n \\n8 GE 1, supra note 1, at 28-29; Tr. at 46 \\n \\n9 Tr. at 47-48. \\n \\n10 AE B (Biography, dated February 15, 2015), at 2-3; Applicant’s Answer to the SOR, supra note 3, at 3-5, \\n\\n8; Tr. at 29-33, 46-48, 53-54. \\n\\n \\n11 GE 3 (Personal Subject Interview, dated November 18, 2010), at 1-2; GE 3 (Personal Subject Interview, \\n\\ndated December 6, 2010), at 1; Tr. at 50-51, 54; Applicant’s Answer to the SOR, supra note 3, at 1-2. \\n\\n \\n3 \\n                                      \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "On  or  about  July  27,  2010,  one  of  Applicant’s  supervisors  approached  him  and \\nasked  to  see  the  photos  of  his  residence  reconstruction  project.  Applicant’s  GFE \\ncomputer wallpaper included photographs of his then-girlfriend in a bikini. After viewing \\nher photos and photos of the residence, the supervisor departed. What occurred next is \\nunclear.  Applicant  was  initially  of  the  belief  that  she  went  directly  to  the  information \\ntechnology  (IT)  department  and  asked  that  Applicant’s  GFE  computer  be  scanned. \\nThere is also some evidence that Applicant’s  GFE was merely randomly scanned. The \\nactual fact in this regard in unimportant. According to an incident report filed on July 30, \\n2010, the scan of Applicant’s GFE found that he had been accessing websites for online \\ndating which were characterized as “inappropriate,” as well as 15 photos that were also \\ncharacterized as “inappropriate.” Two of the photos were deemed “sexually explicit” and \\n“pornographic” in nature.12  \\n\\n \\nOn  July  28,  2010,  Applicant  was  terminated  from  his  employment  without \\nwarning due to “violation of company policy” and “unauthorized use of GFE for sexually \\nexplicit  or  sexually  oriented materials.”13  Although  the  SOR  alleged  that Applicant  was \\nterminated  from  employment  for  “viewing  pornographic  websites,”  the  evidence  upon \\nwhich  the  allegations  are  based,  the  Incident  History,  simply  refers  to  them  as \\n“inappropriate websites.”14 The two terms are not synonymous. \\n\\n \\nThere  is  no  IT  report  of  specific  findings,  a  report  of  investigation  by  the \\nemployer, a copy of the company policy supposedly violated by Applicant, copies of the \\ntroublesome  photographs,  or  explicit  descriptions  of  what  were  construed  as  sexually \\nexplicit  of  pornographic,  in  evidence.  There  is  no  evidence  of  any  subsequent  alleged \\nmisuse of GFE or violations of company policies.15 \\n\\n \\n\\nForeign Influence \\n \\n \\nOver  a  period  estimated  by  Applicant  to  be  15  months,  Applicant  chatted  with \\nvarious  foreign  individuals  while  playing  online  games  and  involved  in  online  dating.  He \\nexplained  that  to  be  successful  in  these  games,  it  was  necessary  to  “ally”  with  as  many \\nindividuals  as  possible  to  assist  him  in  winning.  The  games  required  communication  and \\noccasional  chats.  Applicant’s  online  dating  resulted  in  “relationships”  with  several  foreign \\nwomen, but none of those “relationships” involved physically seeing or meeting the women \\nexcept by telephone, or photographs and videos.  \\n \\n\\nOne such “relationship” with a woman in the Philippines in November 2009 involved \\nhis sending various sums of money to her via Western Union. Applicant’s two explanations \\nregarding  the  amounts  sent  her  are  inconsistent.  He  told  an  investigator  from  the  U.S. \\nOffice  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM)  in  October  2010  that  he  had  sent  her  $6,000  for \\nplane reservations, $7,000 for her father’s medical care, and $25 for support.  He changed \\n                                                                                                                                                                                           \\n\\n \\n12 Tr. at 82-83; GE 3 (Personal Subject Interview (November 18, 2010)), supra note 11, at 1. \\n \\n13 GE 2 (Incident Report, dated August 6, 2013). \\n \\n14 GE 2, supra note 13. \\n \\n15 Tr. at 56. \\n\\n \\n4 \\n                                      \\n \\n\\n\n",

He changed the amounts during the hearing, and said he sent her $370 to \\nbuy  out  her  contract.

Once the Government has produced \\nsubstantial  evidence  of  a  disqualifying  condition,  under  Directive  ¶  E3.1.15,  the \\napplicant  has  the  burden  of  persuasion  to  present  evidence  in  refutation,  explanation, \\nextenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s \\ncase. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.36  \\n\\nthe  Government  predicated  upon \\n\\n \\nA  person  who  seeks  access  to  classified  information  enters  into  a  fiduciary \\ntrust  and  confidence.  This \\nrelationship  with \\nrelationship  transcends  normal  duty  hours  and  endures  throughout  off-duty  hours  as \\nwell.  It  is  because  of  this  special  relationship  that  the  Government  must  be  able  to \\nrepose  a  high  degree  of  trust  and  confidence  in  those  individuals  to  whom  it  grants \\naccess  to  classified  information.  Decisions  include,  by  necessity,  consideration  of  the \\npossible  risk  the applicant may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to safeguard  classified \\ninformation. Such decisions  entail  a  certain degree  of  legally  permissible  extrapolation \\nas  to  potential,  rather  than  actual,  risk  of  compromise  of  classified  information.  \\nFurthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of \\ndenials.”37 \\n\\n \\nClearance  decisions  must  be  “in  terms  of  the  national  interest  and  shall  in  no \\nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”38 Thus, nothing \\nin this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole \\nor in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, \\nor  patriotism.

Under  AG ¶ \\n40(e),  security  concerns  may  be  raised  by  the  “unauthorized  use  of  a  government  or \\nother  information  technology  system.”  This  guideline  generally  refers  to  sending  or \\nsoliciting sexually-oriented messages or images, or the downloading, creating, storing, \\nor  displaying  computer  files  of  a  sexual  nature.  In  mid-2010,  Applicant  opened  an \\nInternet  site  on  his  GFE  that  his  employer  considered  an  “inappropriate”  website.  The \\nsole  evidence  pertaining  to  it  was  the  name,  and  that  name,  without  more,  seems  to \\nindicate  it  was  an  online  dating  website.  There  is  zero  evidence  that  it  was  a \\n“pornographic”  website.  In  July  2010,  while  he  was  again  on  the  GFE,  he opened  two \\nunsolicited  e-mails  addressed  to  him.  One  of  the  e-mails  contained  photos  of  nude \\nwomen  and  the  other  contained  a  photo  of  what  he  considered  offensive.  Applicant \\npromptly  deleted  the  e-mails.  He  also  had  photos  of  his  scantily  clad  girlfriend  on  his \\nscreen saver and wall paper. A subsequent computer scan of his GFE conducted by the \\nIT department revealed the access to the “inappropriate” website as well as the photos \\nthat  were  characterized  as  “inappropriate.”  Two  of  the  photos  were  deemed  “explicit” \\nand  “pornographic”  in  nature.  As  a  result,  the  following  day,  Applicant  was  terminated \\nfrom his employment due to “violation of company policy” and “unauthorized use of GFE \\nfor sexually explicit or sexually oriented materials.” AG ¶ 40(e) has been established. \\n \\n \\nThe  guideline  also  includes  examples  of  conditions  that  could  mitigate  such \\nsecurity  concerns.  Under  AG  ¶  41(a),  the  disqualifying  condition  may  be  mitigated \\nwhere  “so much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it happened under \\nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \\nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.” Similarly, AG ¶ 41(c) applies \\nwhere  “the  conduct  was  unintentional  or  inadvertent  and  was  followed  by  a  prompt, \\ngood-faith effort to correct the situation and by notification of supervisor.”  \\n \\n \\nWhile  Applicant  did  not  promptly  notify  his  supervisor,  he  did  confer  with  a \\ncolleague to determine what to do, and he immediately deleted the e-mails in an effort \\nto correct the situation. According to the apparent prevailing community standards, the \\nemployer  considered  two  of  the  photos  to  be  “sexually  explicit”  and  “pornographic”  in \\n\\n \\n9 \\n                                      \\n \\n\\n\n",

Department  Counsel  argued  that  this  was  not  the  only  such  incident  and  that \\nApplicant  “had  a  history  of  viewing  this  material.”39  His  argument  is  based  purely  on \\nspeculation,  for  there  is  no  evidence  to  suggest  that  it  happened  more  than  once. \\nNevertheless,  even  assuming  the  accuracy  of  the  allegation,  the  passing  of  over  four \\nand  one-half  years  from  the  incident  to  the  date  the  SOR  was  issued,  without \\nrecurrence,  is  sufficient  to  conclude  that  it  is  unlikely  to  recur,  and  it  no  longer  casts \\ndoubt  on  Applicant’s  reliability,  trustworthiness,  and  good  judgment.

Of  special  interest  is  any  failure  to  provide  truthful \\nand  candid  answers  during  the  security  clearance  process  or  any  other \\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \\n \\nThe  guideline  notes  conditions  that  could  raise  security  concerns.  Under  AG  ¶ \\n\\n16(c), security concerns may be raised by:  \\n\\ncredible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is not \\nsufficient  for  an  adverse  determination  under  any  other  single  guideline, \\nbut  which,  when  considered  as  a  whole,  supports  a  whole-person \\nassessment  of  questionable  judgment,  untrustworthiness,  unreliability, \\nlack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \\ncharacteristics  indicating  that  the  person  may  not  properly  safeguard \\nprotected information. \\n\\nAlso, it is potentially disqualifying under AG ¶ 16(e) when there is: \\n\\npersonal conduct, or concealment of information about one’s conduct, that \\ncreates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1) \\nengaging  in  activities  which,  if  known,  may  affect  the  person’s  personal, \\nprofessional, or community standing. . . .  \\n\\nThe  alleged  behavior  consisted  of  being  involuntarily  terminated  from  his \\nemployment  in  July  2010  for  “viewing  pornographic  websites.”  Applicant  has  been \\nconsistent  in  his  rendition  of  the  facts.  The  evidence  is  not  in  dispute.  Applicant  was \\ninvoluntarily  terminated  from  his  employment  due  to  “violation  of  company  policy”  and \\n“unauthorized  use  of  GFE  for  sexually  explicit  or  sexually  oriented  materials.”  The  IT \\nscan  of  Applicant’s  GFE  revealed  that  he  viewed  an  “inappropriate”  online  dating \\nwebsite, but there is zero evidence that the website was “pornographic” in nature.

AG ¶¶ 16(c) and 16(e) have been partially established.  \\n\\n \\nThe  guideline  also  includes  examples  of  conditions  that  could  mitigate  security \\nconcerns  arising  from  personal  conduct.  AG  ¶  17(c)  may  apply  if  “the  offense  is  so \\nminor,  or  so  much  time  has  passed,  or  the  behavior  is  so  infrequent,  or  it  happened \\nunder such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on \\nthe individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.”  \\n\\n \\nSimilarly, AG ¶ 17(d) may apply if “the individual has acknowledged the behavior \\nand  obtained  counseling  to  change  the  behavior  or  taken  other  positive  steps  to \\nalleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \\nor  other  inappropriate  behavior,  and  such  behavior  is  unlikely  to  recur.”  Also,  if  “the \\nindividual  has  taken  positive  steps  to  reduce  or  eliminate  vulnerability  to  exploitation, \\nmanipulation, or duress,” AG ¶ 17(e) may apply. \\n\\n  \\nIn  July  2010,  during  a  period  when  Applicant  was  under  substantial  emotional \\nstress,  he  was  involuntarily  terminated  from  his  employment  due  to  “violation  of \\ncompany policy” and “unauthorized use of GFE for sexually explicit or sexually oriented \\nmaterials.” The alleged behavior, both the viewing of an “inappropriate website as well \\nas  the  opening  of  unsolicited  e-mails  each  occurred  on  one  occasion,  over  four  and \\none-half years before the SOR was issued. Applicant took positive efforts to reduce or \\neliminate  the  behavior  of  online  dating  and  game-playing.  He  remarried.  He  was \\nsubsequently  evaluated  by  a  licensed  psychologist  and  found  to  be  free  of  any \\npsychological  disorders.  He  acknowledged  his  behavior.  There  is  no  evidence  of  any \\nsubsequent  alleged  personal  conduct.  Considering  the  fact  that  the  “inappropriate” \\nwebsite dealt with online dating, and not pornography, the significance of the personal \\nconduct  is  minimized.  Applicant  has  reduced  or  eliminated  his  vulnerability  to \\nexploitation, and through his rehabilitative efforts, the  alleged untrustworthy, unreliable, \\nor other inappropriate behavior, is unlikely to recur. AG ¶¶ 17(c), 17(d), and 17(e) apply. \\n \\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \\n \\n\\nThe security concern under the Foreign Influence guideline is set out in AG ¶ 6:       \\n\\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \\nany  foreign  interest.  Adjudication  under  this  Guideline  can  and  should \\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \\nfinancial \\nto,  such \\nconsiderations  as  whether  the  foreign  country  is  known  to  target  United \\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \\nrisk of terrorism. \\n\\nincluding,  but  not \\n\\ninterest \\n\\nis \\n\\nlocated, \\n\\nlimited \\n\\n \\n\\n11 \\n\\n                                      \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \\nAG  ¶  7(a),  it  is  potentially  disqualifying  where  there  is  “contact  with  a  foreign  family \\nmember, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of \\nor  resident  in  a  foreign  country  if  that  contact  creates  a  heightened  risk  of  foreign \\nexploitation,  inducement,  manipulation,  pressure,  or  coercion.”  Similarly,  under  AG  ¶ \\n7(e), security concerns may be raised when there is  “a substantial business, financial, \\nor  property  interest  in  a  foreign  country,  or  in  any  foreign-owned  or  foreign-operated \\nbusiness,  which  could  subject  the  individual  to  heightened  risk  of  foreign  influence  or \\nexploitation.  \\n\\nApplicant  is  not  a  naturalized  U.S.  citizen.  He  was  born  in  the  United  States  of \\nparents  who  were  also  born  in  the  United  States.  His  entire  immediate  and  extended \\nfamily members are also U.S. citizens. There is no evidence (or allegations) that he has \\nany  family  members  or  business  or  professional  associates  who  are  citizens  or \\nresidents of a foreign  country. In 2009 and 2010, he did, however, have long-distance \\nonline and telephone relationships with several women who were foreign-born residents \\nof  various  countries.  Although  he  never  physically  saw  or  met  the  women,  except  by \\ntelephone, photographs, or videos, he did send them various sums of money, estimated \\nto  be  a  total  in  excess  of  $60,000,  allegedly  earmarked  by  the  recipients  for \\ntransportation,  medical  care,  support,  and  release \\nfrom  a  customs.  Applicant \\nacknowledged that some of the women were taking advantage of him in scams, but he \\nwas not aware of the truth until later. He denied having a bond of affection, loyalty, or \\nfriendship  obligation  for  any  of  the  foreign  nationals  with  whom  he  had  the \\naforementioned “relationships.”   \\n\\nApplicant’s online dating and gaming forays with foreign women ceased in 2011 \\nwhen  he  met  the  woman  who  eventually  became  his  second  wife.  The  security \\nsignificance  of  these  identified  conditions  requires  further  examination  of  Applicant’s \\nformer  foreign  “relationships”  to  determine  the  degree  of  “heightened  risk”  or  potential \\nconflict  of  interest.  Furthermore,  Department  Counsel  argued  that  Applicant’s  actions \\nrevealed  cloudy  judgment,  a  lack  of  self-discipline,  and  a  vulnerability    to  possible \\nmanipulation and exploitation.  The SOR alleged that Applicant wired money to various \\noversea  locations  “in  an  attempt  to  incite  the  relationships.”  (Emphasis  added).40  The \\nevidence  is  persuasive  that,  after  nearly  three  decades  of  marriage  and  a  separation \\nand pending divorce, Applicant was active in online dating and simply wished to make \\nthe right social connection with a female. Nevertheless, AG ¶¶ 7(a) and 7(e) are partially \\nestablished. \\n\\nThe  guideline  also  includes  examples  of  conditions  that  could  mitigate  security \\nconcerns  arising  from  foreign  influence.  Under  AG  ¶  8(a),  the  disqualifying  condition \\nmay be mitigated where: \\n\\n                                                           \\n\\n40  It  is  unclear  why  the  word  “incite”  was  used  in  the  SOR  for  that  word  generally  conveys  a  negative \\nimplication, such as to stir up, fan the flames of, provoke, inflame, egg on, whip up, or foment. The evidence seems to \\ninfer another meaning such as encourage, kindle, arouse, or stimulate.  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n12 \\n\\n                                      \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "the  nature  of  the  relationships  with  foreign  persons,  the  country  in  which \\nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \\nthat  country  are  such  that  it  is  unlikely  the  individual  will  be  placed  in  a \\nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \\ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.  \\n\\nSimilarly, AG ¶ 8(b) may apply where the evidence shows:  \\n\\nthere  is  no  conflict  of  interest,  either  because  the  individual's  sense  of \\nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \\nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \\nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \\nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest. \\n\\nIn  addition,  AG  ¶  8(c)  may  apply  where  “contact  or  communication  with  foreign \\ncitizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk \\nfor foreign influence or exploitation.”  \\n\\nIn  assessing  whether  there  is  a  heightened  risk  because  of  an  applicant’s \\n“relationships”  in  foreign  countries,  it  is  necessary  to  consider  all  relevant  factors, \\nincluding the totality of an applicant’s conduct and circumstances in light of any realistic \\npotential  for  exploitation.  One  such  factor  is  the  potential  for  pressure,  coercion, \\nexploitation,  or  duress.  In  that  regard,  it  is  important  to  realize  that  Applicant  never \\nintended to, and did not, leave the U.S. to enter any of the foreign countries, and that \\nhis  sole  intent  was  to  have  individuals  travel  to  the  U.S.  for  brief  visits  to  explore \\npossible continuing relationships. In fact, none of those foreign women ever entered the \\nU.S., and their sole purpose was seemingly to scam money from Applicant. Yes, he did \\nsend the women substantial sums of money, but any “relationships” that he might have \\ndeveloped with them ceased in 2010 or 2011, at least four years before the SOR was \\nissued.  In  those  circumstances,  there  is  very  little  potential  for  pressure,  coercion, \\nexploitation, or duress.  \\n\\n \\nApplicant’s  immediate  family  and  extended  family  still  reside  in  the  U.S.,  and \\nthose  foreign  women  still  remain  overseas  without  any  continuing  contact  with \\nApplicant.  There  is  no  risk,  much  less  a  “heightened  risk,”  of  foreign  exploitation, \\ninducement,  manipulation,  pressure,  or  coercion  to  disqualify  Applicant  from  holding  a \\nsecurity  clearance  because  of  any  close  or  continuing  relationship  with  those  foreign \\nwomen.  While  Applicant  may  have  been  somewhat  naive,  and  displayed  a  lack  of \\njudgment, in falling for scams and sending such large sums of money to strangers, I am \\npersuaded that Applicant’s loyalty to the United States is steadfast and undivided, and \\nthat he has “such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that [he] \\ncan be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.” AG ¶¶ \\n8(a), 8(b), and 8(f) apply. \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n13 \\n\\n                                      \\n \\n\\n\n",

Moreover, I have evaluated the various \\naspects  of this  case  in  light  of the  totality  of  the  record evidence and have  not merely \\nperformed a piecemeal analysis.41       \\n\\nThere  is  some  evidence  against  mitigating  Applicant’s  use  of  information \\ntechnology  systems,  personal  conduct,  and  foreign  influence  concerns.  Applicant  was \\ninvoluntarily  terminated  from  his  employment  due  to  “violation  of  company  policy”  and \\n“unauthorized  use  of  GFE  for  sexually  explicit  or  sexually  oriented  materials.”  The  IT \\nscan  of  Applicant’s  GFE  revealed  that  he  viewed  an  “inappropriate”  online  dating \\nwebsite,  and on one occasion  in  July  2010, he  opened  two  unsolicited  e-mails,  one of \\nwhich  happened  to  contain  photos  of  nude  women,  and  the  other  of  which  contained \\nsomething  that  he  considered  “offensive.”  In  2009  and  2010,  he  engaged  in  long-\\ndistance online and telephone relationships with several women who were foreign-born \\nresidents of various countries. He sent them various sums of money, estimated to be a \\ntotal  in  excess  of  $60,000,  allegedly  earmarked  by  the  recipients  for  transportation, \\nmedical care, support, and release from a customs.  \\n\\nThe  mitigating  evidence  under  the  whole-person  concept  is  more  substantial. \\nApplicant’s alleged behavior occurred over four and one-half years before the SOR was \\nissued, and there is no evidence of subsequent conduct of a similar nature. There is no \\nevidence  of  a  personality  disorder.  Applicant  has  a  good  reputation  for  reliability, \\ntrustworthiness,  good  moral  character,  integrity,  discretion,  loyalty,  honesty,  efficiency, \\nprofessionalism,  problem-solving  skills,  and  a  strong  work  ethic.  He  was  active  in  his \\ncommunity,  and  served  as  a  middle  school  basketball  coach,  as  well  as  a  basketball \\nreferee and baseball umpire for 12 years.

He  first  began  working  for  that  contractor  in  about \\nFebruary  2010,  but  subsequently  has  been  employed  by  other  companies.  He \\ngraduated  from  high  school  in  2002,  attended  college  without  earning  a  degree,  and \\nqualified as an emergency medical technician (EMT). From 2002 to 2008, he served in \\nthe  Army  National  Guard,  achieved  the  grade  of  specialist  (E-4),  and  received  an \\nhonorable discharge. He deployed to Iraq from January 2007 to February 2008. He is \\ndivorced  and  has  a  child  who  is  nine  years  old.  He  was  first  granted  a  security \\nclearance in 2004.2 \\n \\n\\nThe  SOR  alleged  under  Guideline  K  that  Applicant  committed  three  security \\nviolations in 2010 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.c). Under Guideline E, the SOR alleged the he was \\ncharged with assault on a family member in 2009 (SOR ¶ 2.a); that he was terminated \\nfrom a job during a probationary period in 2009 (SOR ¶ 2.b); that he was counseled for \\nneglect of duty and falsification in 2009 (SOR ¶ 2.c); that he illegally gained access to a \\nhotel in 2009 (SOR ¶ 2.d); that he was returned early from an overseas assignment and \\nplaced  on  probation  in  2010  (SOR  2.e);  and  that  he  falsified  his  responses  to  two \\nquestions in an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) (SOR ¶¶ \\n2.f and 2.g). The allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.c were also cross-alleged under Guideline \\nE in a single allegation (SOR ¶ 2.h). In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the \\nallegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.c, and 2.a-2.e, did not respond to the allegation in SOR ¶ \\n2.h, and denied the remaining allegations.3 \\n \\n                                                           \\n\\n1 Tr. 10-11, 42. \\n\\n2 Tr. 5-6, 62, 65, 92-93, 102-104; GE 1, 2. \\n\\n3 Applicant’s Answer to the SOR. \\n\\n \\n2 \\n \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.c,  2.e,  and  2.h  –  three  security  violations  in  a  two-month \\nperiod,  being  returned  from  an  overseas  assignment  without  completing  a \\ncontract,  and  being  placed  on  probation  in  2010.  From  March  to  April  2010, \\nApplicant worked as a security guard for a company [hereafter referred to as “Company \\nA”]  at  an  overseas  location.  In  that  job,  his  duties  included  verifying  the  eligibility  of \\nthose seeking access to controlled spaces and classified information. \\n\\n \\nOn March 1, 2010, a team leader at Company A issued a memorandum for the \\nrecord (MFR) that reflected Applicant closed, but did not lock, a safe in a secured space \\nand failed to record properly the opening and closing of the safe and the logging in and \\nout of classified documents. (Allegation in SOR 1.a). Applicant was counseled to ensure \\nthat  all  procedures  were  followed,  especially  those  concerning  the  safeguarding  of \\nclassified \\ninstances  of  unsatisfactory \\nperformance  would  result  in  more  severe  corrective  action.  The  MFR  reflected  it  was \\nplaced in “personnel file,” but it does not contain Applicant’s signature or any indication \\nthat he was shown it or informed about it.4 \\n\\ninformation,  and  admonished \\n\\nthat \\n\\nfurther \\n\\n \\nApplicant testified that he never willfully violated any security protocol that was \\nproperly  explained  to  him.  This  incident  occurred  soon  after  he  began  working  for \\nCompany A. He arrived at the overseas location less than 48 hours before the incident. \\nIt happened his first day on the job. He claimed that he was not given proper guidance \\non the opening and closing of the safe. The safe was not secure because he failed to \\nspin the lock dial. The safe was located in a secure room and the classified information \\nwas not subject to compromise. Additionally, a person cleared for classified information \\nsigned out a document, but Applicant did not know there was a part of the document \\nthat he was required to fill out. He acknowledged that he made mistakes because he did \\nnot ask enough questions and stated he did not thereafter make those same mistakes \\nagain.5 \\n \\nOn March 10, 2010, a team leader at Company A issued a MFR that reflected \\nApplicant failed to follow orders by permitting a non-cleared worker to have access to \\nthe controlled access area (CAA) without verifying the worker was on the CAA access \\nroster. (Allegation in SOR ¶ 1.b). Applicant was questioned about this security violation \\nand  stated  that  he  recognized  the  worker.  The  MFR  noted  that  the  worker  had  just \\nreturned from a leave of absence and had not yet been placed back on the CAA access \\nroster.  The  MFR  also  indicated  that  it  would  serve  as  a  written  reprimand  of \\nunsatisfactory performance. The MFR reflected it was placed in “personnel file,” but it \\ndoes  not  contain  Applicant’s  signature  or  any  indication  that  he  was  shown  it  or \\ninformed about it.6 \\n                                                           \\n\\n4 GE 2, 3. \\n\\n5 Tr. 13, 21-34, 41; GE 2; Applicant’s Answer to the SOR. \\n\\n6 GE 2, 4. Interestingly, the text of the MFR issued on April 19, 2010, referred to an incident that \\n\\noccurred on May 17-18, 2010. An email attached to the MFR corrected those dates to April 17-18, 2010. \\n\\n \\n3 \\n \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "Applicant testified that this was his second day working at a particular post. He \\nstated  that  he  read  the  wrong  weekly  CAA  access  roster  at  the  post  and  the  non-\\ncleared worker was listed on that roster. This was an outdated access roster. Applicant \\nclaimed  that,  due  to  a  clerical  error,  the  individual  was  not  added  to  the  most  recent \\naccess roster. He claimed he recognized the individual as being a person on the access \\nroster from the previous day, but that was the wrong access roster. When the error was \\ndiscovered,  the  old  roster  was  taken  away  and  a  new  roster  was  issued  with  the \\nindividual in question added to it. Applicant stated his team leader  was upset that he \\nhad not checked the latest access roster. He was counseled for this incident, but did not \\nremember receiving a written warning at that time.7 \\n\\n \\nOn  April  19,  2010,  a  team  leader  at  Company  A  issued  a  MFR  that  reflected \\nApplicant failed to conduct properly a page inventory of classified documents on April \\n17,  2010.  (Allegation  in  SOR  ¶  1.c).  The  MFR  noted  that  two  of  the  documents  had \\nbeen  previously  combined  and  another  had  48  pages  removed  for  destruction. \\nApplicant’s  inventory  failed  to  account  for  the  missing  pages.  He  was  asked  how  he \\nconducted the inventory and responded by saying he conducted a page-by-page count. \\nWhen asked to explain the discrepancy involving the missing pages, he acknowledged \\nhis mistake.

Usually the guards would rotate between the posts each night. On the night in \\nquestion, however, the schedule did not rotate the guards between the posts. Applicant \\nand  the  other  guard  assumed  their  assignments  were  rotated  and  stood  them  in  that \\nmanner. In doing so, they signed the logs for the wrong posts.

       "The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \\naccess  to  classified  information.  This  relationship  transcends  normal  duty  hours  and \\nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \\npossible  risk  that  the  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  safeguard \\nclassified  information.  Such  decisions  entail  a  certain  degree  of  legally  permissible \\nextrapolation  of  potential,  rather  than  actual,  risk  of  compromise  of  classified \\ninformation. Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in \\nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. \\nOr.  10865  §  7.  See  also  Executive  Order  12968  (Aug.  2,  1995),  Section  3.  Thus,  a \\nclearance  decision  is  merely  an  indication  that  the  Applicant  has  or  has  not  met  the \\nstrict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing \\na clearance. \\n\\n \\nInitially,  the  Government  must  establish,  by  substantial  evidence,  conditions  in \\nthe  personal  or  professional  history  of  the  applicant  that  may  disqualify  the  applicant \\nfrom being eligible for access to classified information.

The  administrative  judge  should  consider  the \\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  \\n\\nthe  conduct, \\n\\nthe  nature,  extent,  and  seriousness  of \\nto \\n\\nthe \\nthe  conduct;  (2) \\n(1) \\ncircumstances  surrounding \\ninclude  knowledgeable \\nparticipation;  (3)  the  frequency  and  recency  of  the  conduct;  (4)  the \\nindividual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \\nwhich  participation \\nthe  presence  or  absence  of \\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \\nfor  the  conduct;  (8)  the  potential  for  pressure,  coercion,  exploitation,  or \\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \\n\\nis  voluntary;  (6) \\n\\nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \\nmust  be  an  overall  commonsense  judgment  based  upon  careful  consideration  of  the \\nguidelines and the whole-person concept. After considering the whole-person evidence \\nin the record, I continue to have questions and doubts about Applicant’s eligibility and \\nsuitability for a security clearance. From the foregoing, I conclude that Applicant failed to \\nmitigate the handling protected information and personal conduct security concerns.  \\n\\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR are:          \\n \\n\\nParagraph 1, Guideline K:   \\n  Subparagraphs 1.a-1.c:   \\n \\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:   \\n  Subparagraphs 2.a-2.h:   \\n\\n AGAINST APPLICANT \\nAgainst Applicant \\n\\nAGAINST APPLICANT \\nAgainst Applicant \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nIn  light  of  all  the  circumstances  presented  by  the  record,  it  is  not  clearly \\nconsistent  with  the  national  interest  to  grant  or  continue  Applicant’s  eligibility  for  a \\nsecurity clearance.

The  action  was  taken  under  Executive  Order  10865,  Safeguarding \\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \\nDefense  Directive  5220.6,  Defense  Industrial  Personnel  Security  Clearance  Review \\nProgram  (January  2,  1992),  as  amended  (Directive);  and  the  adjudicative  guidelines \\n(AG) effective within the Department of Defense after September 1, 2006.  \\n\\n  \\nOn July 11, 2014, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a decision on the \\n \\nrecord. Department Counsel issued a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on July 7, 2015.  \\nApplicant received the FORM on  August 14, 2015. He had 30 days from his receipt of \\nthe  FORM  to  submit  additional  information  in  response  to  the  FORM.  Applicant \\nrequested  an  extension  until  October  19,  2015,  to  submit  matters  in  response  to  the \\nFORM. His Response to the FORM and attached documents are admitted as Item  12. \\nDepartment  Counsel  had  no  objection  to  Applicant’s  Response  to the  Form.  (Item  13) \\nOn November 5, 2015, the FORM was forwarded to the Hearing Office and assigned to \\nme  on  November  9,  2015.  Based  upon  a  review  of  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and \\ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \\n\\n \\n1 \\n \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "Findings of Fact \\n\\n \\n\\nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admits to all SOR allegations.  (Item 2)    \\n\\n \\n \\n \\nApplicant  is  a  43-year-old  employee  of  a  DOD  contractor  seeking  to  obtain  a \\nsecurity clearance. He has worked for his current employer since July 2011. Previously, \\nhe owned his own construction company from October 2007 to July 2011. He has been \\nmarried and divorced twice. He is currently married to his third wife and has a five-year-\\nold son and a three-year-old daughter. He also has a stepson. (Item 3; Item 12)   \\n\\n \\nOn  July  20,  2011,  Applicant  submitted  an  electronic  questionnaire \\n\\nfor \\ninvestigation  processing  (e-QIP).  (Item  3)  A  subsequent  background  investigation \\nrevealed  Applicant  encountered \\nfinancial  problems.  Specifically,  Applicant  was \\napproximately $95,326 past due on a mortgage (SOR ¶ 1.a: Item 6 at 2; Item 7 at 2); he \\nowed a $654 judgement entered against him in November 2009 on behalf of a hospital \\n(SOR  ¶  1.b:  Item  6  at  1;  Item  7  at  1;  Item  9  at  1);  and  he  filed  for  bankruptcy  under \\nChapter  7  in  June  2010.  The  Chapter  7  bankruptcy  was  converted  to  a  Chapter  13 \\nbankruptcy. (SOR ¶ 1.c: Item 5 at 1; Item 6 at 1; Item 7 at 1; Item 10).   \\n\\n \\nIn  his  response  to  the  SOR,  dated  December  11,  2014,  Applicant  admits  to  all \\nallegations,  but  claims  the  debts  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.b  are  included  in  his \\nbankruptcy.    The  Chapter  13  bankruptcy  repayment  plan  required  him  to  pay  $164 \\npayments over a period of 60 months. Applicant indicated he is timely making payments \\nand will continue to do so until the plan is complete in August 2015. (Item 2 at 6)  \\n\\n \\nIn a response to Interrogatories, dated July 15, 2013, Applicant indicated that he \\nfiled for bankruptcy because of his divorce from his second wife in 2009 and as a result \\nof business deal that went bad. He built seven houses for a contractor and was never \\npaid.  He  believes  one  of  the  creditors  (a  mortgage)  included  in  his  bankruptcy  is  the \\nsame as the mortgage alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a. (Item 4 at 9)  \\n\\n \\nApplicant  received  financial  counseling  as  a  requirement  of  his  bankruptcy \\nprocess.  (Item  4  at  13,  25-29)  In  July  2013,  he  also  completed  a  personal  financial \\nworksheet.  His  net  monthly  income  was  $2,851.  He  had  $2,297  in  total  monthly \\nexpenses. After expenses, he had $554 left over in discretionary income. (Item 4 at 22)  \\n\\n \\nIn his response to the FORM, Applicant provided all of his Chapter 13 bankruptcy \\npaperwork. He completed his payment plan and the Chapter 13 bankruptcy is complete. \\nHe  provided  a  copy  of  the  Discharge  of  Debtor  After  Completion  of  Chapter  13  Plan, \\ndated  September  28,  2015.  He  provided  a  copy  of  his  payment  history.  He  also \\nprovided a portion of a TransUnion credit report which indicates the debt alleged in SOR \\n¶  1.b  was  included  in  the  Chapter  13  bankruptcy.  He  is  still  not  sure  where  the \\nmortgage debt came from. It is no longer on his credit report and his attorney assures \\nhim that it was included in the bankruptcy.

       "He said he has made his share of mistakes, but has done everything he could to \\nrectify  the  situation.    Everything  he  does  is  motivated  by  making  his  children’s  lives \\nbetter.  He  explained  he  became  bankrupt  as  a  result  of  his  previous  job  in  the \\nconstruction  business.  Applicant  built  houses.  His  business  partners  backed  out  when \\nthe real estate business slowed down and left Applicant with thousands of unpaid bills. \\nAt  the  same  time,  his  ex-wife  incurred  some  bills  that  he  could  not  afford  to  repay. \\nApplicant is now able to pay his bills. His pay has increased an additional $8 an hour. \\n(Item 12) \\n   \\n\\nPolicies \\n\\n \\n\\nWhen  evaluating  an  applicant’s  suitability \\n\\n \\nthe \\nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \\nintroductory  explanations  for  each  guideline,  the  adjudicative  guidelines  list  potentially \\ndisqualifying  conditions  and  mitigating  conditions,  which  must  be  considered  when \\ndetermining an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. \\n\\nfor  a  security  clearance, \\n\\n \\nThese  guidelines  are  not  inflexible  rules  of  law.  Instead,  recognizing  the \\ncomplexities  of  human  behavior,  these  guidelines  are  applied  in  conjunction  with  the \\nfactors  listed  in  the  adjudicative  process.  The  administrative  judge’s  overarching \\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 2(c), \\nthe  entire  process  is  a  conscientious  scrutiny  of  a  number  of  variables  known  as  the \\n“whole-person  concept.”  The  administrative  judge  must  consider  all  available,  reliable \\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \\ndecision. \\n\\n \\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) \\nrequires  that  “[a]ny  doubt  concerning  personnel  being  considered  for  access  to \\nclassified  information  will  be  resolved  in  favor  of  national  security.”  In  reaching  this \\ndecision,  I  have  drawn  only  those  conclusions  that  are  reasonable,  logical,  and  based \\non the evidence contained in the record.  \\n\\n \\nUnder  Directive  ¶  E3.1.14,  the  Government  must  present  evidence  to  establish \\ncontroverted  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  Under  Directive  ¶  E3.1.15,  the  applicant  is \\nresponsible  for  presenting  “witnesses  and  other  evidence  to  rebut,  explain,  extenuate, \\nor  mitigate  facts  admitted  by  applicant  or  proven  by  Department  Counsel.  .  .  .”  The \\napplicant  has  the  ultimate  burden  of  persuasion  as  to  obtaining  a  favorable  security \\ndecision.  \\n\\nthe  Government  predicated  upon \\n\\n \\nA  person  who  seeks  access  to  classified  information  enters  into  a  fiduciary \\nrelationship  with \\ntrust  and  confidence.  This \\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \\nGovernment  reposes  a  high  degree  of  trust  and  confidence  in  individuals  to  whom  it \\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \\nthe  possible  risk  the  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  protect  or \\nsafeguard  classified  information.  Such  decisions  entail  a  certain  degree  of  legally \\n\\n \\n3 \\n \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "permissible  extrapolation  as  to  potential,  rather  than  actual,  risk  of  compromise  of \\nclassified information. \\n\\n  \\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of \\nthe  national  interest  and  shall  in  no  sense  be  a  determination  as  to  the  loyalty  of  the \\napplicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \\n \\n\\n \\n\\nAnalysis \\n\\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \\n\\nout in AG & 18:       \\n \\n\\nFailure  or  inability  to  live  within  one=s  means,  satisfy  debts,  and  meet \\nfinancial  obligations  may  indicate  poor  self-control,  lack  of  judgment,  or \\nunwillingness  to  abide  by  rules  and  regulations,  all  of  which  can  raise \\nquestions  about  an  individual=s  reliability,  trustworthiness  and  ability  to \\nprotect  classified \\nfinancially \\noverextended  is  at  risk  of  having  to  engage  in  illegal  acts  to  generate \\nfunds.  \\n\\ninformation.  An \\n\\nindividual  who \\n\\nis \\n\\n \\n\\nThe  guideline  notes  several  disqualifying  conditions  that  could  raise  security \\nconcerns. I find AG &19(a) (an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); and AG &19(c) \\n(a  history  of  not  meeting  financial  obligations)  apply  to  Applicant’s  case.  Applicant \\nencountered  financial  problems  since  2008,  which  resulted  in  a  bankruptcy  filing  in \\n2010.   \\n \\nAn  individual  who  is  financially  irresponsible  may  also  be  irresponsible, \\nunconcerned, or careless in their obligations to protect classified information. Behaving \\nirresponsibly in one aspect of life provides an indication of how a person may behave in \\nother  aspects  of  life.  A  person’s  relationship  with  his  creditors  is  a  private  matter  until \\nevidence  is  uncovered  demonstrating  an  inability  or  unwillingness  to  pay  debts  under \\nagreed  terms.  Absent  evidence  of  strong  extenuating  or  mitigating  circumstances,  an \\napplicant with a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk \\ninconsistent with the holding of a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be \\ndebt free, but is required to manage his finances in such a way as to meet his financial \\nobligations.  \\n\\n \\nThe  Government’s  substantial  evidence  and  Applicant’s  own  admissions  raise \\nsecurity  concerns  under  Guideline  F.  The  burden  shifted  to  Applicant  to  produce \\nevidence  to  rebut,  explain,  extenuate,  or  mitigate  the  security  concerns.  (Directive \\n¶E3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden \\nof  disproving  it  never  shifts  to  the  Government.

       "The  guideline  also  includes  examples  of  conditions  that  could  mitigate  security \\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties.

He has a history of \\nfinancial  delinquencies,  including  delinquent  debts  owed  to  eight  creditors  in  the \\napproximate  amount  of  $37,847.  While  Applicant  has  either  resolved  or  is  making \\npayments  on  five  of  his  debts,  he  failed  to  establish  that  three  others  are  being \\naddressed. Applicant has  not mitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns \\nbecause he has failed to show he  acted responsibly with respect to  these outstanding \\ndebts. He mitigated the Foreign Influence security concerns created by his mother, two \\nsisters, and three brothers, who are all citizens and residents of Vietnam. Eligibility for \\naccess to classified information is denied.  \\n \\n\\nStatement of the Case \\n\\n \\n\\nOn  December  5,  2014,  the  Defense  Office  of  Hearings  and  Appeals  (DOHA) \\nissued  a  Statement  of  Reasons  (SOR)  to  Applicant  detailing  security  concerns  under \\nGuideline  F,  Financial  Considerations  and  Guideline  B,  Foreign  Influence.  The  action \\nwas  taken  under  Executive  Order  (EO)  10865,  Safeguarding  Classified  Information \\nwithin  Industry  (February  20,  1960),  as  amended;  Department  of  Defense  Directive \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n1 \\n\\n\n",
       "5220.6,  Defense  Industrial  Personnel  Security  Clearance  Review Program  (January  2, \\n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective for cases \\nafter September 1, 2006. (Item 1.) \\n\\n \\nApplicant responded to the SOR (Answer) on January 11, 2015 and February 2, \\n \\n2015. (Item 1.) He requested that his case be decided by an administrative judge on the \\nwritten  record.  Department  Counsel  submitted  the  Government’s  written  case  on  April \\n21,  2016.  A  complete  copy  of  the  File  of  Relevant  Material  (FORM),  containing  five \\nItems, was received by Applicant on April 27, 2016. He was afforded an opportunity to \\nfile objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation within 30 days \\nof  his  receipt of  the  FORM.  Applicant  submitted documents  marked  Applicant  Exhibits \\n(AE) A through K in response to the FORM within the 30-day period that ended May 27, \\n2016.  Department  Counsel  had  no  objection  to  AE  A  through  AE  K,  and  they  are \\nadmitted into the record. DOHA assigned the case to me on December 13, 2016.  \\n \\n\\nProcedural Rulings \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nIn  the  FORM,  the  Government  requested  I  take  administrative  notice  of  certain \\nfacts  relating  to  Vietnam.  Department  Counsel  provided  a  five-page  summary  of  the \\nfacts,  supported  by  five  Government  documents  pertaining  to  Vietnam,  identified  as \\nItem  6.  The  documents  provide  elaboration  and  context  for  the  summary.  I  take \\nadministrative  notice  of  the  facts  included  in  the  U.S.  Government  reports.  They  are \\nlimited to matters of general knowledge, not subject to reasonable dispute. They are set \\nout in the Findings of Fact. \\n\\n \\n\\nFindings of Fact \\n\\n \\n \\nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations in subparagraphs 2.a and 2.b. He failed \\nto explicitly admit or deny SOR subparagraph 1.a through 1.h, and as a result, they will \\nbe treated as denials. (Item 1.) After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, and \\nexhibits, I make the following findings of fact. \\n \\n \\nApplicant is 51 years old. He was born in Vietnam and immigrated to the United \\nStates. He attended a U.S. high school. He became a U.S. citizen in 1981.  He earned \\nan  associate’s  degree  in  1984  from  a  U.S.  college.  He  was  employed  by  a  federal \\ncontractor from February 2011 until he was laid off in February 2013. He is married to a \\nU.S. citizen, and has two children who are U. S. citizens. (Item 2.) \\n \\n \\napproximate amount of $37,847. His debts are as follows. \\n \\n \\nApplicant  is  delinquent  on  his  $257,199  primary  mortgage  in  the  amount  of \\n$10,420,  as  alleged  in  SOR  subparagraph  1.a.  He  presented  documentation  showing \\nhe made payments of $2,085 to this creditor on December 26, 2014, January 20, 2015, \\nand  May  14,  2016.  He  indicated  in  a  letter  that  he  was  trying  to  bring  this  account \\ncurrent. However, he failed to establish a regular payment history and document that he \\nbrought this debt current. It remains unresolved. (Item 1; AE A; AE B.) \\n\\nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleges Applicant is indebted to eight creditors in the \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n2 \\n\\n\n",
       "Applicant  was  delinquent  on  a  $17,986  second  mortgage  in  the  amount  of \\n \\n$2,295, as  alleged  in SOR  subparagraph 1.b.  He  presented a  letter  from this  creditor, \\ndated March 15, 2015, which reflected this debt was paid in full on March 11, 2016. It is \\nresolved. (Item 1; AE C.) \\n \\n \\nApplicant was indebted on a charged-off credit card in the amount of $20,632, as \\nalleged in SOR subparagraph 1.c. He presented a letter from this creditor, dated March \\n9, 2013, which reflected this debt was paid in full. It is resolved. (Item 1; AE D.) \\n \\n \\nApplicant was delinquent on an $11,935  vehicle loan in the amount of $618, as \\nalleged in SOR subparagraph 1.d. Applicant presented a copy of a receipt for a check in \\nthe  amount  of  $710,  dated  April  29,  2016,  and  an  account  statement  that  shows \\nApplicant’s loan was current as of March 30, 2016, with an unpaid balance of $7,422.50 \\nremaining on the loan. Applicant is current on this debt. (Item 1; AE E; AE F.)  \\n \\n \\nApplicant  is  indebted  on  a  charged-off  account  in  the  amount  of  $2,654,  as \\nalleged in SOR subparagraph 1.e. He produced a written payment agreement with this \\ncreditor,  which  shows  he  agreed  to  make  monthly  payments  of  $100.  He  produced \\ndocumentation that shows he made one $100 payment on May 14, 2016.  This debt is \\nbeing resolved. (AE H.) \\n \\n \\nApplicant is indebted on a charged-off account in the amount of $530, as alleged \\nin SOR subparagraph 1.f. Applicant produced no documentation that corresponds with \\nthis account. It is unresolved. (Item 5.) \\n \\nApplicant is indebted on a charged-off account in the amount of $409, as alleged \\n \\nin  SOR  subparagraph  1.g.  Applicant  produced  a  letter  from  a  collection  agent  on  this \\naccount, which offered to settle this debt for a payment of $229.06. He failed to produce \\ndocumentation  to  show  he  made  any  payments  to  the  creditor  under  this  agreement. \\n(AE K.)  \\n \\n \\nApplicant  was  indebted  on  a  charged-off  account  in  the  amount  of  $289,  as \\nalleged  in  SOR  subparagraph  1.h.  Applicant  presented  a  receipt  dated  May  20,  2016, \\nwhich shows Applicant paid this debt. It is resolved. (AE J.) \\n \\n \\nApplicant  attributed  his  delinquencies  to  a  reduction  of  hours  at  his  previous \\nemployer, his wife’s unemployment, and his current unemployment. He also noted that \\nhe was aiding his daughter with her university expenses. (AE A.) Applicant provided no \\nrecent household budget showing monthly household expenses, although an April 2013 \\npersonal financial statement showed his expenses exceeded his income by more than \\n$1,000 per month. (Item 3.) He did not provide a copy of his current earnings statement. \\nWithout updated information, I am unable to assess his current financial status, and his \\nability  or  willingness  to  repay  his  remaining  delinquent  debt  and  avoid  future \\ndelinquencies. The record lacks any evidence of credit or financial counseling.  \\n \\n \\nUnder  Guideline  B,  the  SOR  alleges  Applicant’s  mother,  two  sisters,  and  three \\nbrothers  are  citizens  and  residents  of  Vietnam.  Applicant’s  mother  is  unemployed.  He \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n3 \\n\\n\n",
       "communicates  with  her  on  a  monthly  basis  by  phone  and  sees  her  yearly,  when  she \\nvisits  the  United  States.  One  of  Applicant’s  sisters  is  a  waitress,  and  the  other  is  a \\nconstruction  helper.  Applicant’s  brothers  are  unemployed.  Applicant  has  not  seen  his \\nsiblings  in  person  since  1997.  He  communicates  with  them  approximately  once  per \\nmonth.  None  of  his  relatives  in  Vietnam  is  employed  by  the  Vietnamese  government. \\nHis family members in Vietnam are not aware he has applied for a security clearance. \\n(Item 3.)  \\n \\n \\nVietnam is an authoritarian state ruled by the Communist Party of Vietnam. The \\nVietnamese Government arbitrarily arrests and detains individuals for political activities. \\nThe  Government  limits  freedom  of  speech,  religion,  and  the  press.  U.S.  citizens  have \\nbeen detained after traveling in the area of closed borders with China, Cambodia, and \\nLaos.  By  Vietnamese  law,  anyone  born  to  at  least  one  Vietnamese-citizen  parent  is \\nconsidered to be a Vietnamese citizen. (Item 6.) \\n \\n\\nPolicies \\n\\n \\n\\nWhen  evaluating  an  applicant’s  suitability \\n\\n \\nthe \\nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \\nintroductory  explanations  for  each  guideline,  the  adjudicative  guidelines  list  potentially \\ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \\napplicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. \\n \\n\\nfor  a  security  clearance, \\n\\nThese  guidelines  are  not  inflexible  rules  of  law.  Instead,  recognizing  the \\ncomplexities  of  human  behavior,  administrative  judges  apply  the  guidelines  in \\nconjunction with the factors listed in AG ¶ 2(a), describing the adjudicative process. The \\nadministrative \\nimpartial,  and \\ncommonsense  decision.  According  to  AG  ¶ 2(c),  the  entire  process  is  a  conscientious \\nscrutiny  of  a  number  of  variables  known  as  the  “whole-person  concept.”  The \\nadministrative  judge  must  consider  all  available,  reliable  information  about  the  person, \\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \\n\\njudge’s  overarching  adjudicative  goal \\n\\nis  a \\n\\nfair, \\n\\n \\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) \\nrequires  that  “[a]ny  doubt  concerning  personnel  being  considered  for  access  to \\nclassified  information  will  be  resolved  in  favor  of  national  security.”  In  reaching  this \\ndecision,  I  have  drawn  only  those  conclusions  that  are  reasonable,  logical,  and  based \\non the evidence contained in the record.  \\n\\n \\nUnder  Directive  ¶  E3.1.14,  the  Government  must  present  evidence  to  establish \\ncontroverted  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  Under  Directive  ¶  E3.1.15,  the  applicant  is \\nresponsible  for  presenting  “witnesses  and  other  evidence  to  rebut,  explain,  extenuate, \\nor  mitigate  facts  admitted  by  the  applicant  or  proven  by  Department  Counsel.”  The \\napplicant  has  the  ultimate  burden  of  persuasion  to  obtain  a  favorable  clearance \\ndecision.  \\n\\n \\nA  person  who  seeks  access  to  classified  information  enters  into  a  fiduciary \\ntrust  and  confidence.  This \\n\\nthe  Government  predicated  upon \\n\\n \\nrelationship  with \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n4 \\n\\n\n",
       "relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \\nGovernment  reposes  a  high  degree  of  trust  and  confidence  in  individuals  to  whom  it \\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \\nthe  possible  risk  the  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  protect  or \\nsafeguard  classified  information.  Such  decisions  entail  a  certain  degree  of  legally \\npermissible  extrapolation  as  to  potential,  rather  than  actual,  risk  of  compromise  of \\nclassified information. \\n \\n\\nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be “in terms of the \\nnational  interest  and  shall  in  no  sense  be  a  determination  as  to  the  loyalty  of  the \\napplicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \\n \\n\\nAnalysis \\n\\nThe  security  concern  for  Financial  Considerations  is  set  out  in  AG  ¶  18,  as \\n\\nfollows:       \\n \\n\\nFailure  or  inability  to  live  within  one’s  means,  satisfy  debts,  and  meet \\nfinancial  obligations  may  indicate  poor  self-control,  lack  of  judgment,  or \\nunwillingness  to  abide  by  rules  and  regulations,  all  of  which  can  raise \\nquestions  about  an  individual’s  reliability,  trustworthiness  and  ability  to \\nprotect  classified \\nfinancially \\noverextended  is  at  risk  of  having  to  engage  in  illegal  acts  to  generate \\nfunds.  \\n \\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise a security concern under \\n\\ninformation.  An \\n\\nindividual  who \\n\\nis \\n\\nAG ¶ 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \\n \\n\\n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \\n \\n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \\n\\n \\n \\nApplicant  had  a  history  of  financial  delinquencies  that  he  had  been  unable  to \\nresolve,  including  delinquent  debts  to  eight  creditors  in  the  approximate  amount  of \\n$37,847,  as  alleged  in  the  SOR.  The  Government  established  the  disqualifying \\nconditions in AG ¶ 19(a) and 19(c). Further inquiry about the applicability of mitigating \\nconditions is required.  \\n \\n \\napplicable:  \\n\\nFive Financial Considerations mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially \\n\\n \\n(a)  the  behavior  happened  so  long  ago,  was  so  infrequent,  or  occurred \\nunder  such  circumstances  that  it  is  unlikely  to  recur  and  does  not  cast \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n5 \\n\\n\n",

His debt is current and on-going as demonstrated by the \\nunresolved debts in SOR subparagraphs 1.a, 1.f, and 1.g. Applicant’s conduct does not \\nwarrant application of AG ¶ 20(a).  \\n \\nApplicant’s debts, which were identified in the SOR, may have been due, in part, \\n \\nto his unemployment and underemployment and his wife’s unemployment. However, he \\nalso  made  the  decision  to  pay  for  his  daughter’s  university  education,  instead  of  his \\nprimary  mortgage  and  other  debts.  Further,  he  failed  to  demonstrate  responsible \\nbehavior  toward  those  accounts  that  remain  unresolved.  AG  ¶  20(b)  is  only  partially \\nmitigating. \\n \\n \\nApplicant  provided  no  evidence  of  the  depth  or  duration  of  any  financial \\ncounseling.  There  are  no  clear  indications  that  his  delinquent  debts  in  subparagraphs \\n1.a,  1.f,  and  1.g  are  being  resolved  or  are  under  control.  Mitigation  under  AG  ¶  20(c) \\nhas not been established. \\n \\n \\nApplicant  resolved  the  debts  in  subparagraphs  1.b,  1.c,  and  1.h,  and  is  making \\npayments  toward  the  resolution  of  the  debts  in  subparagraphs  1.d  and  1.e.  Mitigation \\nunder AG ¶ 20(d) applies in part to the debts identified in subparagraphs 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, \\n1.e, and 1.h. \\n \\n \\nAG  ¶  20(e)  requires  Applicant  to  provide  documented  proof  to  substantiate  the \\nbasis of any dispute or provide evidence of actions to resolve the issue.

       "The  security  concern  relating  to  the  guideline for  Foreign  Influence  is  set  out  in \\n\\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \\n \\n \\nAG ¶ 6: \\n \\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \\nany  foreign  interest.  Adjudication  under  this  Guideline  can  and  should \\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \\nfinancial \\nto,  such \\nconsiderations  as  whether  the  foreign  country  is  known  to  target  United \\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \\nrisk of terrorism. \\n\\nincluding,  but  not \\n\\ninterest \\n\\nis \\n\\nlocated, \\n\\nlimited \\n\\n \\n\\nThe  guideline  notes  several  conditions  that could  raise  security  concerns  under \\n\\nAG ¶ 7. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \\n\\n \\n(a)  contact  with  a  foreign  family  member,  business  or  professional \\nassociate,  friend,  or  other  person  who  is  a  citizen  of  or  resident  in  a \\nforeign  country  if  that  contact  creates  a  heightened  risk  of  foreign \\nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \\n \\n(b)  connections  to  a  foreign  person,  group,  government,  or  country  that \\ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual’s obligation to \\nprotect  sensitive  information  or  technology  and  the  individual’s  desire  to \\nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information. \\n \\nApplicant’s  mother  and  five  siblings  are  Vietnamese  citizens  and  reside  in  the \\n  \\nVietnam. Due to his ties to his family, and the threats present in Vietnam as set out in \\nItem  6,  a  heightened  risk  of  foreign  exploitation,  inducement,  manipulation,  pressure, \\nand  coercion  is  present.  The  evidence  is  sufficient  to  raise  the  above  disqualifying \\nconditions. \\n \\n \\nof the mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 8 including: \\n \\n\\nAG ¶ 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \\n\\n(a) the nature of the relationship with foreign persons, the country in which \\nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \\nthat  country  are  such  that  it  is  unlikely  the  individual  will  be  placed  in  a \\nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \\ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.;  \\n \\n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual’s sense of \\nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \\nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n7 \\n\\n\n",
       "and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \\nconflict of interests in favor of the U.S. interests; and \\n \\n(c)  contact  or  communication  with  foreign  citizens  is  so  casual  and \\ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \\ninfluence or exploitation. \\n \\nApplicant  maintains  relationships  with  his  mother  and  siblings,  who  are  citizens \\nand residents of Vietnam. His contact with his mother is the most frequent. The Appeal \\nBoard has held that there is a rebuttable presumption that ties with immediate family are \\nnot  casual.1  The  evidence  shows  that  Applicant  maintains  his  relationship  with  his \\nmother  during  the  year  through  phone  calls  and  her  annual  visits.  He  also  maintains \\nregular contact with his siblings, although that contact is not as frequent as it is with his \\nmother. While none of Applicant’s foreign family members are aware of his request for a \\nsecurity  clearance,  given  these  facts  and  Applicant's  close  ties  to  his  foreign  family \\nmembers, I cannot confidently conclude that Applicant could not be placed in a position \\nof having to choose between the interests of foreign individuals and the interests of the \\nUnited States. AG ¶ 8 (a) and (c) do not apply. \\n\\n \\n Applicant  has  established  deep  and  longstanding  relationships  in  the  United \\nStates. He spent a formative part of his youth in the U.S and attended college here. He \\nchose  to  stay  in  the  United  States  after  finishing  his  education.  He  became  a  U.S. \\ncitizen.  He  is  married  to  an  American  citizen.  His  children  are  U.S.  citizens.  Applicant \\ncan  be expected  to  resolve  any  conflict  of  interest  in favor  of  the  United  States.  AG  ¶ \\n8(b) is mitigating. \\n \\nWhole-Person Concept \\n \\n \\nUnder  the  whole-person  concept,  the  administrative  judge  must  evaluate  an \\napplicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s \\nconduct  and  all  relevant  circumstances.  The  administrative  judge  should  consider  the \\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  \\n \\n\\nthe  nature,  extent,  and  seriousness  of \\nto \\n\\nthe  conduct;  (2) \\nthe \\n(1) \\ncircumstances  surrounding \\ninclude  knowledgeable \\nparticipation;  (3)  the  frequency  and  recency  of  the  conduct;  (4)  the \\nindividual’s  age  and maturity  at  the  time  of the  conduct;  (5)  the  extent to \\nwhich  participation \\nthe  presence  or  absence  of \\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \\nfor  the  conduct;  (8)  the  potential  for  pressure,  coercion,  exploitation,  or \\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \\n\\nthe  conduct, \\n\\nis  voluntary;  (6) \\n\\n \\nUnder AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant  eligibility for a security \\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \\nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \\n\\n                                                           \\n1 ISCR Case No. 00-0484 at 4-5 (App. Bd.

       " \\n\\nI  considered  the  potentially  disqualifying  and  mitigating  conditions  in  light  of  all \\nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \\nGuidelines F and B in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were \\naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. The Foreign \\nInfluence  concerns  related  to  Applicant’s  mother  and  siblings,  who  are  citizens  and \\nresidents  in Vietnam, are mitigated. However,  Applicant has not acted in a trustworthy \\nmanner  when  it  comes  to  addressing  his  financial  delinquencies.  There  is  insufficient \\nevidence  to  demonstrate  that  recurrence  of  financial  irresponsibility  is  unlikely.  The \\npotential for pressure, coercion, or duress remains undiminished. \\n\\n \\nOverall,  the  record  evidence  leaves  me  with  questions  and  doubts  as  to \\nApplicant’s  eligibility  and  suitability  for  a  security  clearance.  For  all  these  reasons,  I \\nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Financial Considerations security concerns. \\n\\n \\n\\nFormal Findings \\n\\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \\n\\n \\n \\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \\n \\n\\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nSubparagraphs 1.a:  \\nSubparagraphs 1.b:  \\nSubparagraphs 1.c:  \\nSubparagraphs 1.d:  \\nSubparagraphs 1.e:  \\nSubparagraphs 1.f:   \\nSubparagraphs 1.g:  \\nSubparagraphs 1.h:  \\n \\n\\nParagraph 2, Guideline B:   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nSubparagraph 2.a:   \\nSubparagraph 2.b:   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\nAGAINST APPLICANT \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\nAgainst Applicant \\nFor Applicant \\nFor Applicant \\nFor Applicant \\nFor Applicant \\nAgainst Applicant \\nAgainst Applicant \\nFor Applicant \\n\\nFOR APPLICANT \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\nFor Applicant \\nFor Applicant \\n\\nConclusion \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it  is not \\nclearly  consistent  with  the  national  interest  to  grant  Applicant  eligibility  for  a  security \\nclearance.

       "The Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On\\nAugust 19, 2015, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\\ndecision–security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of\\nDefense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a decision\\non the written record.  On June 27, 2016, after considering the record, Defense Office of Hearings\\nand Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Martin H. Mogul denied Applicant’s request for a\\nsecurity clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive ¶¶ E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\\n\\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in making findings\\nof fact and whether the Judge’s decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent\\nwith the following, we affirm.\\n\\nThe Judge’s Findings of Fact  \\n\\nApplicant is 46 years old, married, and has four children.  He earned a bachelor’s degree in\\n1994.    Since  2010,  he  has  been  employed  by  a  defense  contractor.    In  his  security  clearance\\napplication, he explained that he encountered difficultly paying bills in 2008 after being laid off\\nfrom a second job due to the company’s bankruptcy.  He gave no explanation for why he did not\\nbegin attempting to resolve the debts until the issuance of the SOR.\\n\\nApplicant admitted each of the five delinquent debts alleged in the SOR.  For the debt in\\nSOR  ¶  1.a  for  about  $500,  Applicant  wrote  in  his  Response  to  Department  Counsel’s  File  of\\nRelevant Material (FORM) that the debt was paid off.  The creditor agreed to accept three monthly\\npayments of about $100 to settle the debt.  A document showed the creditor made arrangements with\\nApplicant to debit electronically about $100 from his account in September 2015 for this debt.  For\\nthe 2009 judgment in SOR ¶ 1.b for about $14,000, Applicant indicated that, at the time he answered\\nthe SOR, he was unable to negotiate a settlement.  In his Response to the FORM, he provided\\ndocuments showing his wages were being garnished biweekly for the next six months for this debt\\nand about $350 was garnished from his pay at the end of November 2015.  No evidence was\\npresented to establish the total amount deducted from his pay or how much is still owed on that debt. \\nFor the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 1.b, and 1.c for about $2,500, $5,600, and $3600, Applicant wrote in\\nhis Response to the FORM that he is currently on a schedule to repay between $150 and $190 a\\nmonth on each debt until it is resolved.  He provided proof of payments toward those debts from\\nSeptember through November 2015.\\n\\nThe Judge’s Analysis\\n\\nThe  Judge  found  Applicant  did  not  act  responsibly  because,  even  though  he  has  been\\nemployed by his current employer since 2010, he only began making payments towards the debts\\nafter the SOR was issued.  The Judge also concluded that, while the mitigation condition concerning\\nthe initiation of a good-faith effort to repay the creditors was applicable, it was not controlling\\nbecause Applicant must establish a consistent history of continuing to resolve his debts. \\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\n2\\n\\n\n",
       "In the appeal brief, Applicant provided character reference letters and documents showing\\npayments  on,  or  settlement  of,  various  debts.    Most  of  those  documents,  however,  were  not\\npreviously submitted to the Judge and constitute new evidence that the Appeal Board is prohibited\\nfrom receiving or considering.  Directive ¶ E3.1.29.  \\n\\nApplicant claims the Judge erred in the findings of fact.  For example, he states that he has\\nsix children (instead of four) and started working for his current employer in 2012 (instead of 2010). \\nIn  his  security  clearance  application,  however,  Applicant  listed  that  he  had  four  children  and\\nindicated he started working for his employer in 2010.  He failed to establish that the Judge erred\\nin the findings of fact.  Our review reveals the Judge’s material findings are based upon substantial\\nevidence or constitute reasonable inferences or conclusions that could be drawn from the record\\nevidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-03420 at 3 (App. Bd. July 25, 2014).  Applicant also argues\\nthat he mitigated the security concerns arising from his debts.  His arguments are not sufficient to\\nshow that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to\\nlaw.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-06634 at 2 (App. Bd. Apr. 28, 2016).   \\n   \\n\\nThe Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the\\ndecision.  The decision is sustainable on this record.  “The general standard is that a clearance may\\nbe granted only when ‘clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.’” Department\\nof the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  See also Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b):  “Any doubt\\nconcerning personnel being considered for access to classified information will be resolved in favor\\nof the national security.”\\n\\nThe Decision is AFFIRMED.  \\n\\nOrder\\n\\nSigned: Michael Ra’anan        \\nMichael Ra’anan\\nAdministrative Judge\\nChairperson, Appeal Board\\n\\nSigned: James E.

As  reviewed  above,  Applicant  began  working  at  his present\\nemployment in 2010, but he gave no explanation for why he did not begin attempting to\\nresolve his debts until  2015, after the SOR was issued. \\n\\nnd\\n\\nPolicies\\n\\nWhen  evaluating  an  applicant’s  suitability \\n\\nthe\\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\\nto  brief  introductory  explanations  for  each  guideline,  the  adjudicative  guidelines  list\\npotentially  disqualifying  conditions  and  mitigating  conditions,  which  are  useful  in\\nevaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information.\\n\\nfor  a  security  clearance, \\n\\nThese  guidelines  are  not  inflexible  rules  of  law.  Instead,  recognizing  the\\ncomplexities  of  human  behavior,  these  guidelines  are  applied  in  conjunction  with  the\\nfactors  listed  in  the  adjudicative  process.  The  administrative  judge’s  over-arching\\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 2(c),\\nthe  entire  process  is  a  conscientious  scrutiny  of  a  number  of  variables  known  as  the\\n“whole-person  concept.”  The  administrative  judge  must  consider  all  available,  reliable\\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\\ndecision.\\n\\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b)\\nrequires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\\ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this decision, I have\\ndrawn  only  those  conclusions  that  are  reasonable,  logical  and  based  on  the  evidence\\ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere\\nspeculation or conjecture.\\n\\nUnder  Directive  ¶  E3.1.14,  the  Government  must  present  evidence  to  establish\\ncontroverted  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  Under  Directive  ¶  E3.1.15,  the  Applicant  is\\nresponsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\\nmitigate  facts  admitted  by  applicant  or  proven  by  Department  Counsel.  .  .  .”  The\\n\\n3\\n\\n\n",
       "Applicant  has  the  ultimate  burden  of  persuasion  as  to  obtaining  a  favorable  security\\ndecision. \\n\\nA  person  who  seeks  access  to  classified  information  enters  into  a  fiduciary\\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government\\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\\nthe  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  protect  or  safeguard  classified\\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as\\nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\\n\\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of\\nthe  national  interest and  shall in no  sense be  a determination  as  to the  loyalty  of  the\\napplicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \\n\\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\\n\\nAnalysis\\n\\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\\n\\nout in AG ¶ 18:  \\n\\n      Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet\\nfinancial  obligations  may  indicate  poor  self-control,  lack  of  judgment,  or\\nunwillingness  to  abide  by  rules  and  regulations,  all  of  which  can  raise\\nquestions  about  an  individual’s  reliability,  trustworthiness  and  ability  to\\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \\n\\nThe  guideline  notes  several  conditions  that  could  raise  security  concerns  and\\ncould potentially apply in this case.  Under AG ¶ 19(a), “an inability or unwillingness to\\nsatisfy  debts,”  is  potentially  disqualifying.  Similarly  under  AG  ¶  19(c),  “a  history  of  not\\nmeeting  financial  obligations,”  may  raise  security  concerns.  I  find  that  both  of  these\\ndisqualifying  conditions  apply  to  Applicant  in  this  case.  The  evidence  has  established\\nthat Applicant accumulated significant delinquent debt several years ago.  \\n\\nAG ¶ 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns from financial\\ndifficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(b), it may be mitigating where, “the conditions that resulted in\\nthe financial problem were largely beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment,\\na  business  downturn,  unexpected  medical  emergency,  or  a  death,  divorce  or\\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.” As reviewed\\nabove,  some  of  Applicant’s  financial  difficulties  occurred  as  a  result  of  his  periods  of\\nunemployment. However, since Applicant has been employed by his current employer\\nsince 2010, and only began making payments toward the SOR debts after the SOR was\\n\\n4\\n\\n\n",
       "issued in 2015, I find that Applicant has not acted responsibly. Accordingly, I find that this\\nmitigating condition is not applicable in this case. \\n\\n¶  20(d)  is  now  applicable  but  not  controlling,  since  Applicant  has  begun  taking\\naction to “initiate a good-faith effort to repay his overdue creditors or otherwise resolve\\ndebts,”  because  even  though  he  has  been  working  at  his  present  employment  since\\n2010,  he  did  not  begin  this  process  until  after  the  SOR  was  issued  in  2015.  To  be\\napplicable and controlling in the future, Applicant must establish a consistent history of\\ncontinuing  to  resolve  these  delinquent  past  debts  and  not  become  past  due  on  his\\npresent debts. At this time, I find Guideline F against Applicant.\\n\\nWhole-Person Concept\\n\\nUnder  the  whole-person  concept,  the  administrative  judge  must  evaluate  an\\napplicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s\\nconduct  and  all  the  circumstances.  The  administrative  judge  should  consider  the  nine\\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a): \\n\\nthe  conduct, \\n\\nto \\n\\n(1)  the  nature,  extent,  and  seriousness  of  the  conduct;  (2)  the\\ncircumstances  surrounding \\ninclude  knowledgeable\\nparticipation;  (3)  the  frequency  and  recency  of  the  conduct;  (4)  the\\nindividual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\\nwhich  participation \\nthe  presence  or  absence  of\\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\\nfor  the  conduct;  (8)  the  potential  for  pressure,  coercion,  exploitation,  or\\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\\n\\nis  voluntary;  (6) \\n\\nUnder AG ¶ 2 (c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\\nsecurity  clearance  must  be  an  overall  commonsense  judgment  based  upon  careful\\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.      \\n\\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the\\nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. Based on all of the reasons cited above\\nas to why the mitigating conditions are not applicable at this time, I find that the record\\nevidence leaves me with significant questions and doubts as to Applicant’s eligibility and\\nsuitability  for  a  security  clearance  under  the  whole-person  concept.  For  all  these\\nreasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns under the whole-\\nperson concept. \\n\\nFormal Findings\\n\\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\\n\\nrequired by ¶ E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\\n\\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\\n\\nAGAINST APPLICANT\\n\\nSubparagraphs 1.a. - 1.e.:\\n\\nAgainst  Applicant\\n\\n5\\n\\n\n",

Department  Counsel  and  Applicant  requested  that  I  take \\nadministrative notice of certain facts about Israel. The facts administratively noticed are \\nsummarized in the Findings of Fact, below. \\n \\n\\nFindings of Fact \\n\\n \\n\\nApplicant  admitted  all  of  the  SOR  allegations.  He  is  a  39-year-old  analyst \\nemployed  by  a  defense  contractor  since  March  2015.  He  worked  for  a  prior  defense \\ncontractor,  at  a  U.S.  Embassy  overseas,  from  January  2008  to  February  2009.  He \\nworked for another defense contractor from August 2010 to November 2012. He was \\ngranted eligibility for a public trust position by another federal agency in 2008. He was \\ngranted a DOD security clearance in 2014.1  \\n\\n \\nApplicant  is  a  native-born  U.S. citizen  and  resident. He  obtained  a  high-school \\ndiploma in the United States in 1996 and a bachelor’s degree from a U.S. university in \\n2001. He was previously married from September 2009 to November 2010. As of the \\nhearing, he was engaged to a native-born U.S. citizen. He does not have any children.2 \\n\\n \\nApplicant enlisted and served as an active duty infantryman in the Israeli military \\nfrom November 2004 to February 2006. Upon completion of his service, he declined an \\noffer to serve in the Israeli military reserves and was honorably discharged. His primary \\nmotivation for serving in the Israeli military was to develop the skills and experience that \\nwould assist him in furthering a career in security in support of the U.S. Government. He \\ninitially desired to serve in the U.S. military, but learned when he spoke to recruiters that \\nhe  was  ineligible  due  to  a  longstanding  medical  condition.  He  explored  alternative \\noptions  to  serve  the  U.S.  Government  through  security  positions  with  defense \\ncontractors  and  in  the  private  sector,  but  discovered  that  all  such  positions  required \\nprior military experience. He did not inquire whether his medical condition would have \\ndisqualified him from holding these positions since he did not meet the requisite criteria \\nof  prior  military  service.  He  did  not  explore  options  that  did  not  require  prior  military \\n\\n                                                           \\n1 Applicant’s response to the SOR; Tr. at 24-25, 70-77; GEs 1-3; AE B.  \\n \\n2 Tr. at 55-125; GE 1. \\n \\n\\n \\n2 \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "experience because such positions would not have provided him with the opportunity to \\ndevelop skills in his desired field.3   \\n\\n \\nApplicant discovered through internet research a program designed for overseas \\nJewish volunteers who had an interest in serving in the Israeli military, so long as one \\nprovided evidence of Jewish heritage. He decided then, at the age of 23, that it was a \\nreasonable option for him to serve in the Israeli military given that the United States and \\nIsrael  were  allies  with  mutual  adversaries.  He  made  this  decision  on  his  own.  He \\ndiscussed  his  decision  with  his  parents,  and  their  conversations  revolved  primarily \\naround their concern for Applicant’s safety.4 \\n\\n \\nIn  2004,  Applicant  traveled  to  Israel  to  join  the  Israeli  military.  Acting  on  the \\nrecommendation  that  he  have  a  basic  proficiency  of  Hebrew  prior  to  enlistment, \\nApplicant  first  engaged  in  a  five-month  language  instruction  program.  The  language \\nprogram  was  not  affiliated  with  the  Israeli  military.  He  subsequently  enlisted  and  the \\nIsraeli military sent him to additional language training.5  \\n\\n \\nDuring the enlistment process, Applicant lied and told the Israeli military that he \\ndid  not  have  the  medical  condition  that  rendered  him  ineligible  to  serve  in  the  U.S. \\nmilitary. He did so because he was told, at an initial enlistment meeting when he arrived \\nin Israel, that his longstanding medical condition, combined with another of his medical \\nconditions, would have lowered his physical profile to such a degree that would have \\ndisqualified  him  from  serving  as  an  infantryman.  He  was  previously  unaware  of  this \\ninformation. He understood from his internet research prior to traveling to Israel that he \\nwould  be  permitted  to  serve  in  some  capacity  despite  his  medical  condition.  He  also \\nunderstood that his medical condition was not necessarily a disqualifier for joining the \\ninfantry.6  \\n\\n \\nApplicant  determined  that  while  he  was  unwilling  to  lie  to  the  U.S.  military  and \\ngovernment about this particular medical condition, it was acceptable for him to lie to \\nthe  Israeli  military  and  government  since  he  did  not  have  any  allegiance  to  them.  He \\nwas not concerned his medical condition would be discovered because he managed it \\nand  was  able  to  maintain  a  high  level  of  fitness.  He  disclosed  his  other  medical \\ncondition  and  medical  history to the  Israeli  military.  In the  13  years that  have  passed \\nsince his enlistment in the Israeli military, Applicant has matured. He understands now \\nthat he should have disclosed his longstanding medical condition to the Israeli military, \\neven if such a disclosure would have prevented him from serving as an infantryman.7   \\n  \\n                                                           \\n3 Tr. at 55-125; GEs 1-3; AEs A, C. \\n \\n4 Tr. at 55-125; GE 3.  \\n \\n5 Tr. at 55-125; GEs 2-3. \\n \\n6 Tr. at 55-125; GE 3. \\n \\n7 Tr. at 55-125; GE 3. \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n3 \\n \\n\\n\n",
       " \\nApplicant’s  ex-girlfriend  resides  in  Israel.  He  met  her  on  an  online  dating  site \\nwhen he attended the five-month language instruction program in Israel. He lived with \\nher while he was serving in the Israeli military. He last communicated with her in 2007. \\nWhen  Applicant  moved  back  to  the  United  States  from  Israel  in  2007,  he  had  social \\nmedia contact with her. He also had social media contact with her one sister who also \\nresides  in  Israel,  and  several  individuals  in  Israel  with  whom  Applicant  served  in  the \\nIsraeli  military,  to  include  his  unit  supervisor.  After  he  received  the  SOR,  Applicant \\ndeleted all of his foreign contacts on social media. He had not previously deleted them \\nbecause  he  consulted  and  was  advised  by  a  former  colleague  that  doing  so  at  once \\nmight trigger to any one of his foreign contacts who might be working in the intelligence \\nfield that he was pursuing a sensitive position. He ultimately decided that since he was \\nnot  in  communication  with  any  of  his  foreign  contacts,  he  did  not  need  to  maintain  a \\nsocial  media  connection  with  them.  Since  he  deleted  his  foreign  contacts  on  social \\nmedia, some have tried to reconnect with him but Applicant has not responded and has \\nno intentions of doing so.8 \\n  \\n \\nApplicant maintains contact with one individual, a U.S. citizen and resident, with \\nwhom Applicant served in the Israeli military. This individual is the founder and CEO of \\na civilian national service organization that has no connections to the Israeli government \\nor military. As an American Jew, this individual chose to serve in the Israeli military and \\ndid  so  for  two  years  in  the  same  unit  as  Applicant.  He  attested  that  both  he  and \\nApplicant  were  low-level  infantrymen.  Since  their  discharge  from  the  Israeli  military, \\nApplicant  and \\nindividual  see  each  other  once  yearly  and  communicate \\napproximately twice yearly.9 \\n \\nAfter  graduating  from  college  and  before  he  served  in  the  Israeli  military, \\n \\nApplicant took a trip to Israel in August 2002 through a birthright program. The program \\nhelped teach him about his Jewish culture. Subsequent to his Israeli military service and \\nduring a period of unemployment, he traveled to Israel in June 2010 through the same \\nbirthright  program.  On  this  occasion,  he  served  as  a  volunteer  male  counselor  to  the \\nprogram.  He  did  not  see  any  of  his  former  Israeli  military  contacts  or  his  ex-girlfriend \\nduring this trip. Both trips were comprised of U.S. citizens, all Jewish Americans, who \\nwanted  to  travel  to  Israel  to  learn  more  about  their  Jewish  culture.  He  has  not  since \\ntraveled  to  Israel.  Should  he  travel  to  Israel  or  any  foreign  country  in  the  future,  he \\nunderstands  as  a  security  clearance  holder  the  requirement  to  report  such  foreign \\ntravel.10 \\n \\n \\nApplicant did not have an Israeli security clearance when he served in the Israeli \\nmilitary. He has never been an Israeli citizen, as he was not required to become one in \\norder to serve in the Israeli military, and as such he has never held an Israeli passport. \\nHe chose not to become an Israeli citizen or obtain an Israeli passport because he did \\n\\nthis \\n\\n                                                           \\n8 Tr. at 55-125; GEs 1-3. \\n \\n9 Tr. at 55-125; GEs 1-3; AE F. \\n \\n10 Tr. at 55-125; GEs 1-3. \\n \\n\\n \\n4 \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "not want to leave  any room for misinterpretation as  to where his loyalties lie. He has \\nnever voted in an Israeli election. He earned $6,000 yearly when he served in the Israeli \\nmilitary. He was required to open a bank account in Israel for the direct deposit of that \\nincome. He rented two apartments in Israel as he was required to maintain a home of \\nrecord  during  the  course  of  his  Israeli  military  service.  Since  his  discharge  from  the \\nIsraeli military and move back to the United States, he has not received nor does he \\nexpect to receive any income or benefits from the Israeli government or military. He also \\nclosed his Israeli bank account.11  \\n \\n \\nUpon  his  discharge  from  the  Israeli  military,  Applicant  moved  back  to  and  has \\nsince lived in the United States. He resided with his parents from March 2006 through \\nJanuary 2008. He moved out of his parents’ home and rented at various locations from \\nJanuary 2008 until 2015. Since 2015, he and his fiancée have rented a place together.  \\nHe was briefly unemployed from February to May 2006, and again from November 2012 \\nto  July  2013.  He  has  otherwise  worked  as  a  self-employed  security  consultant  or  a \\ndefense  contractor  as  previously  discussed.  Applicant  and  his \\nfiancée  have \\napproximately  $25,000  in  joint  savings.  Applicant  also  has  approximately  $50,000  in \\nretirement assets in the United States. He does not have any assets in Israel.12 \\n \\n \\nApplicant  testified  that  his  prior  Israeli  military  service  cannot  be  used  against \\nhim,  as  his  family,  friends,  and  coworkers  are  aware  of  it.  His  parents,  sibling,  and \\nfiancée are native-born U.S. citizens and residents. His father worked for many years \\nfor a defense contractor. His fiancée, who works for the U.S. Government and holds a \\nDOD security clearance, testified that Applicant disclosed his Israeli military service to \\nher  when  they  met  in  May  2014.  She  described  Applicant  as  passionate  about  the \\nUnited  States.  Applicant’s  supervisor  also  testified  that  he  was  aware  of  Applicant’s \\nprior Israeli military service and described Applicant as an exceptional performer, with \\nno reason to question his character, integrity, or loyalty to the United States. Applicant \\nalso provided letters of support from his neighbor and mentor, both of whom were also \\naware of Applicant’s Israeli military service and who described Applicant as trustworthy \\nand loyal to the United States.13    \\n \\nIsrael \\n \\n \\nDefense, diplomatic, and economic cooperation between the United States and \\nIsrael has been close for decades. Strong bilateral relations have fueled and reinforced \\nsignificant  cooperation  between  the  United  States  and  Israel  on  defense-related \\nmatters. Aid for Israel has been designed to maintain Israel’s qualitative military edge \\nover neighboring militaries, since Israel must rely on better equipment and training to \\ncompensate for a manpower deficit in any potential regional conflict. However, U.S. aid \\nto  Israel  is  not  unlimited.  Sales  of  U.S.  defense  articles  and  services  to  Israel  are \\nsubject to the Arms Export Control Act (AECA) and the July 23, 1952, Mutual Defense \\n                                                           \\n11 Tr. at 55-125; GEs 1-3; AE F. \\n \\n12 Tr. at 55-125; GE 1. \\n \\n13 Tr. at 55-125; AEs D-E. \\n\\n \\n5 \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "Assistance Agreement between the United  States and Israel. AECA enumerates the \\npurposes  for  which  foreign  governments  can  use  U.S.  military  articles  and  limits  the \\nability of foreign governments to transfer U.S. military products to third party countries \\nwithout the prior consent of the President of the United States. The 1952 agreement \\nstates  that  the  government  of  Israel  assures  the  United  States  government  that \\nequipment, materials, or services acquired from the United States are required for and \\nwill  be  used  solely  to  maintain  Israel’s  internal  security  and  Israel’s  legitimate  self-\\ndefense.  \\n \\n \\nAlthough the United States has provided regular military support to Israel, there \\nis a significant documented history of classified information and controlled technologies \\nbeing illegally imported to Israel. These include parts used in fighter jets, spy software, \\ncomponents  for  certain  missiles  and  fighter  jet  aircraft,  digital  oscilloscopes  that  are \\ncapable of being utilized in the development of weapons of mass destruction and  in \\nmissile  delivery  fields,  a  product  containing  a  certain  chemical  precursor  that  is \\ncontrolled  for  chemical,  biological,  antiterrorism,  and  chemical  reasons,  pressure \\ntransducers  that  are  controlled  for  nuclear  non-proliferation  reasons,  encryption \\nsoftware  that  is  controlled  for  national  security  reasons,  and  classified  documents. \\nIllegal  technology  transfers,  even  to  private  Israeli  entities,  are  a  significant  concern \\nbecause  foreign  government  entities  have  learned  to  capitalize  on  private-sector \\ntechnology acquisitions.  \\n \\n \\nIn the past 30 years, there have been at least three cases in which employees \\nof the U.S. Government were convicted of disclosing classified information to Israel or \\nof  conspiracy  to  act  as  an  Israeli  agent.  Reports  indicate  that  concerns  regarding \\npossible Israeli espionage persist among U.S. officials. The most prominent espionage \\ncase is that of Jonathan Pollard. He pled guilty in 1986, with his then wife, to selling \\nclassified documents to Israel. Israel granted Pollard, who is serving a life sentence in \\na U.S. federal prison, citizenship in 1996 and, in 1998, acknowledged that Pollard had \\nbeen its agent. \\n \\n \\nA  travel  warning  issued  by  the  U.S.  Department  of  State  for  Israel,  the  West \\nBank, and Gaza remains in effect, as the security environment remains complex due to \\nheightened  tensions  and  security  risks.  U.S.  citizens  are  advised  that  all  persons \\nentering or departing Israel, the West Bank, or Gaza are subject to security screening, \\nand may be denied entry or exit. Israeli security officials have on occasion requested \\naccess  to  travelers’  personal  email  accounts  or  other  social  media  accounts  as  a \\ncondition  of  entry.  In  such  circumstances,  travelers  should  have  no  expectation  of \\nprivacy for any data stored on such devices or in their accounts. \\n  \\n\\n \\n\\nWhen  evaluating  an  applicant’s  suitability \\n\\n \\nthe \\nadministrative  judge  must  consider  the  adjudicative  guidelines.  In  addition  to  brief \\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \\ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \\napplicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. \\n\\nfor  a  security  clearance, \\n\\nPolicies \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n6 \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "These  guidelines  are  not  inflexible  rules  of  law.  Instead,  recognizing  the \\ncomplexities  of  human  behavior,  administrative  judges  apply  the  guidelines  in \\nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s \\noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \\nto  AG  ¶  2(a),  the  entire  process  is  a  conscientious  scrutiny  of  a  number  of  variables \\nknown  as  the  “whole-person  concept.”  The  administrative  judge  must  consider  all \\navailable,  reliable  information  about  the  person,  past  and  present,  favorable  and \\nunfavorable, in making a decision. \\n\\n \\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) \\nrequires  that  “[a]ny  doubt  concerning  personnel  being  considered  for  access  to \\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.”  \\n\\n \\nUnder Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \\ncontroverted  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  Under  Directive  ¶  E3.1.15,  the  applicant  is \\nresponsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \\nor  mitigate  facts  admitted  by  the  applicant  or  proven  by  Department  Counsel.”  The \\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \\n\\nthe  Government  predicated  upon \\n\\n \\nA  person  who  seeks  access  to  classified  information  enters  into  a  fiduciary \\n \\nrelationship  with \\ntrust  and  confidence.  This \\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \\nGovernment  reposes  a  high  degree  of  trust  and  confidence  in  individuals  to  whom  it \\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \\nthe  possible  risk  the  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  safeguard \\nclassified  information.  Such  decisions  entail  a  certain  degree  of  legally  permissible \\nextrapolation  of  potential,  rather  than  actual,  risk  of  compromise  of  classified \\ninformation. \\n \\n\\nSection 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be “in terms \\nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \\napplicant  concerned.”  See  also  Exec.  Or.  12968,  Section  3.1(b)  (listing  multiple \\nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \\n\\nAnalysis \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \\n \\n\\nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG ¶ 6:       \\n\\nForeign  contacts  and  interests,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  business, \\nfinancial,  and  property  interests,  are  a  national  security  concern  if  they \\nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \\nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \\nway  inconsistent  with  U.S.  interests  or  otherwise  made  vulnerable  to \\npressure  or  coercion  by  any  foreign  interest.  Assessment  of  foreign \\n\\n \\n7 \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "contacts  and  interests  should  consider  the  country  in  which  the  foreign \\ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \\nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \\nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \\n \\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \\n\\nAG ¶ 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \\n\\ninformation  or \\n\\n \\n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \\nor  professional  associate,  friend,  or  other  person  who  is  a  citizen  of  or \\nresident  in  a  foreign  country  if  that  contact  creates  a  heightened  risk  of \\nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \\n \\n(b)  connections  to  a  foreign  person,  group,  government,  or  country  that \\ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \\nprotect  classified  or  sensitive \\nthe \\nindividual’s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \\nthat information or technology. \\n \\nThe  nature  of  a  nation’s  government,  its  relationship  with  the  United  States, \\nand its human  rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant’s \\nfamily  members  are  vulnerable  to  government  coercion.  The  risk  of  coercion, \\npersuasion,  or  duress  is  significantly  greater \\nforeign  country  has  an \\nauthoritarian  government,  a  family member is associated with or dependent upon the \\ngovernment,  or  the  country  is  known  to  conduct  intelligence  operations  against  the \\nUnited  States.  In  considering  the  nature  of  the  government,  an  administrative  judge \\nmust  also  consider  any  terrorist  activity  in  the  country  at  issue.  See  generally  ISCR \\nCase  No.  02-26130  at  3  (App.  Bd.  Dec.  7,  2006)  (reversing  decision  to  grant \\nclearance  where  administrative  judge  did  not  consider  terrorist  activity  in  area  where \\nfamily members resided). \\n \\n\\ntechnology  and \\n\\nif \\n\\nthe \\n\\nAG  ¶  7(a)  requires  substantial  evidence  of  a  “heightened  risk.”  The \\n“heightened  risk” required to raise one of these disqualifying conditions is a relatively \\nlow standard.  “Heightened risk” denotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in \\nhaving a family member living under a foreign government. \\n\\n \\nApplicant has not communicated with his ex-girlfriend in Israel since 2007. When \\nApplicant moved back to the United States from Israel in 2007, he had limited social \\nmedia contact with her, her one sister, and several other individuals in Israel with whom \\nhe served in the Israeli military. He deleted all of his social media foreign contacts after \\nhe received the SOR. He has not responded and has no intentions of responding to any \\nattempts  by  these  foreign  contacts  to  reconnect  on  social  media.  While  Applicant \\nmaintains  contact with one individual  with  whom he served in the Israeli military, this \\nindividual is a U.S. citizen and resident with no ties to the Israeli government or military.       \\nAG ¶¶ 7(a) and 7(b) are not established. \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n8 \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "Guideline C, Foreign Preference \\n \\n\\nThe security concern for foreign preference is set out in AG ¶ 9:     \\n \\nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign \\ncountry over the United States, then he or she may provide information or make \\ndecisions  that  are  harmful  to  the  interests  of  the  United  States.  Foreign \\ninvolvement  raises  concerns  about  an  individual's  judgment,  reliability,  and \\ntrustworthiness  when  it  is  in  conflict  with  U.S.  national  interests  or  when  the \\nindividual acts to conceal it. By itself; the fact that a U.S. citizen is also a citizen \\nof  another  country  is  not  disqualifying  without  an  objective  showing  of  such \\nconflict or attempt at concealment. The same is true for a U.S. citizen's exercise \\nof any right or privilege of foreign citizenship and any action to acquire or obtain \\nrecognition of a foreign citizenship. \\n \\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \\n\\nAG ¶ 10. The following is potentially applicable in this case:   \\n\\n \\n(d) participation in foreign activities, including but not limited to: \\n\\n(1) assuming or attempting to assume any type of employment, position, or  \\npolitical office in a foreign government or military organization. \\n\\nApplicant’s service in the Israeli military from November 2004 to February 2006 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nraises AG ¶ 10(d).   \\n \\n\\nConditions that could mitigate foreign preference security concerns are provided  \\n\\nunder AG ¶ 11. The following are potentially applicable: \\n \\n\\n(f)  the  foreign  preference,  if  detected,  involves  a  foreign  country,  entity,  or \\nassociation that poses a low national security risk; and \\n \\n(g) civil employment or military service was authorized under U.S. law, or  \\nthe employment or service was otherwise consented to as required by U.S. law. \\n \\n \\nAs  a  23  year  old,  Applicant  decided  that  serving  in  the  Israeli  military  would \\nenable him to further his desired career in security in support of the U.S. Government. \\nSince  his  longstanding  medical  condition,  which  he  determined  he  did  not  have  to \\ndisclose to the Israeli military, rendered him ineligible to serve in the U.S. military, he \\nviewed  his  decision  as  a  reasonable  option.  That  the  United  States  and  Israel  were \\nallies  with  mutual  adversaries  also  factored  into  his  decision.  He  has  matured  since \\nthen.  He  acknowledged  he  should  have  disclosed  his  medical  condition  to  the  Israeli \\nmilitary. His Israeli military service occurred between 11 and 13 years ago. He no longer \\nhas any ties to the Israeli government or military. He has never been an Israeli citizen, \\nhe  has  never  held  an  Israeli  passport,  and  he  has  never  held  an  Israeli  security \\nclearance.

       "Whole-Person Concept \\n \\nUnder  the  whole-person  concept,  the  administrative  judge  must  evaluate  an \\n \\napplicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s \\nconduct  and  all  relevant  circumstances.  The  administrative  judge  should  consider  the \\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d):  \\n \\n\\nthe  conduct, \\n\\nis  voluntary;  (6) \\n\\nthe  nature,  extent,  and  seriousness  of \\nto \\n\\nthe \\nthe  conduct;  (2) \\n(1) \\ncircumstances  surrounding \\ninclude  knowledgeable \\nparticipation;  (3)  the  frequency  and  recency  of  the  conduct;  (4)  the \\nindividual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \\nwhich  participation \\nthe  presence  or  absence  of \\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \\nfor  the  conduct;  (8)  the  potential  for  pressure,  coercion,  exploitation,  or \\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \\n \\n \\nUnder  AG ¶  2(c), the  ultimate  determination  of  whether to  grant  eligibility  for a \\nsecurity  clearance  must  be  an  overall  commonsense  judgment  based  upon  careful \\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \\n \\n\\nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines B and C in my whole-person \\nanalysis.  After  weighing  the  disqualifying  and  mitigating  conditions  under  both \\nguidelines,  and  evaluating  all  the  evidence  in  the  context  of  the  whole  person,  I \\nconclude  Applicant  has  mitigated  the  foreign  influence  and  foreign  preference \\nsecurity  concerns.  Accordingly,  I  conclude  he  has  carried  his  burden  of  showing \\nthat  it  is  clearly  consistent  with  the  national  interest  to  continue  his  eligibility  for \\naccess to classified information. \\n\\n \\n\\nFormal Findings \\n\\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \\n\\n \\n \\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\nParagraph 1, Guideline C:   \\nSubparagraph 1.a:   \\n \\nParagraph 2, Guideline B:   \\nSubparagraphs 2.a - 2.b: \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\nFor Applicant \\nFor Applicant \\nFor Applicant \\nFor Applicant \\n\\nConclusion \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nIn  light  of  all  of  the  circumstances  presented  by  the  record  in  this  case,  it  is \\nclearly  consistent  with  the  national  interest  to  continue  Applicant’s  eligibility  for  a \\nsecurity clearance.

On  November  3,  2014,  the  Department  of  Defense \\nConsolidated  Adjudications  Facility  (DODCAF)  issued  Applicant  a  Statement  of \\nReasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guidelines F and E. The  action was \\ntaken  under  Executive  Order  10865,  Safeguarding  Classified  Information  Within \\nIndustry  (February  20,  1960),  as  amended;  Department  of  Defense  Directive  5220.6, \\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \\namended  (Directive);  and  the  adjudicative  guidelines  (AG)  effective  within  the \\nDepartment of Defense on September 1, 2006.  \\n\\n \\nApplicant  answered  the  SOR  in  writing  on  December  8,  2014.  Applicant \\n\\nrequested his case be decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.  \\n\\n \\nOn April 17, 2015, Department Counsel submitted the Department=s written case. \\nA complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM), consisting of Items 1 to 7, was \\n\\n \\n1 \\n \\n \\n\\n\n",

He admitted the 10 allegations under \\nParagraph  2  alleging  20  personal  conduct  security  violations.  He  further  stated  in  his \\nAnswer  that  Subparagraphs  1.d  to  1.h  were  ”investigated  by  management”  without \\ndisclosing the results of those investigations.

He works as a security guard for a defense contractor. \\nApplicant served in the U.S. Marines from 1998 to 2002. (Items 2-4) \\n \\n \\nApplicant  owes  $129,524  for  these  17  delinquent  debts.  His  Answer  states  he \\npaid  five  debts  (Subparagraphs  1.c,  1.e,  1.h,  1.i,  1.o),  has  installment  agreements  for \\nsix other debts (Subparagraphs 1.a, 1b, 1.d, 1.g, 1.n, 1.p, and 1.q), and is disputing four \\nother  debts  (Subparagraphs  1.j  to  1.m).  The  debt  to  an  insurance  company  in \\nSubparagraph 1.f he simply admits with no other explanation. The earliest debt is dated \\nin 2004.  (Items 1-7) \\n \\n \\nApplicant’s  Personal  Financial  Statement  submitted  with  his  interrogatory \\nanswers  states  his  2004  divorce  and  physical  injury  in  2010  caused  his  financial \\ndifficulties, but they are  “turning around” now.

He did not respond to the FORM. \\n(Items 1-7) \\n \\n \\nApplicant has numerous violations on his work record for his employer, for whom \\nhe has worked since 2004. Applicant had non-medical call-offs between 2004 and 2013, \\ntardiness in the same time, and several counseling sessions. The counseling pertained \\nto  his  possession  of  a  personal  cell  phone  at  the  work  site,  conducting  personal \\nbusiness on a government telephone, having a beverage at the work site, failing to sign \\nin after a meal break, failure to maintain his uniform, failure to execute his duties when \\nhe did not take a key inventory, failure to sign a schedule receipt for four hours of hold \\nover work he performed, failure to park a work vehicle in the correct location for which a \\n\\n \\n\\n2 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "parking ticket was issued to his employer, failure to sign into work, failure to hand carry \\na  package  to  the  addressee  that  resulted  in  a  processing  delay,  and  allowing  an \\nunauthorized  vehicle  to  gain  access  to  a  facility  without  properly  obtaining  valid \\nidentification  from  the  driver  and  vehicle  inspection  in  December  2006.

In  December  2006  termination  was  started,  in  September  2011  Applicant \\nwas suspended for two days after having a cell phone at the work site, and in February \\n2012  he  received  a  one  day  suspension for  being  tardy  for  work  four  times.  Applicant \\nadmitted  all  these  violations  with  the  notation  on  the  disciplinary  accusations  that \\n“management investigated” them. (Items 1-7) \\n \\n \\nApplicant’s file contains several hundred pages of documents listing his violations \\nas  alleged  in  the  SOR  and  the  disciplinary  action  taken  by  his  employer.  These \\ndocuments support each SOR allegation. (Item 4) \\n  \\n\\n     Applicant  did  not  submit  any  documentation  that  he  has  participated  in  credit \\ncounseling or budget education. He provided no evidence concerning the quality of his \\njob  performance.  He  submitted  no  character  references  or  other  evidence  tending  to \\nestablish  good  judgment,  trustworthiness,  or  reliability.

Under  Directive  &  E3.1.15,  an \\n“applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \\nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \\nand  has  the  ultimate  burden  of  persuasion  as  to  obtaining  a  favorable  clearance \\ndecision.”  \\n\\nthe  Government  predicated  upon \\n\\n \\nA  person  who  seeks  access  to  classified  information  enters  into  a  fiduciary \\nrelationship  with \\ntrust  and  confidence.

Such  decisions  entail  a  certain  degree  of  legally \\npermissible  extrapolation  as  to  potential,  rather  than  actual,  risk  of  compromise  of \\nclassified information.

Only  one  mitigating  condition  might  have \\npartial applicability. \\n\\n \\n\\n(b)  the  conditions  that  resulted  in  the  financial  problem  were  largely \\nbeyond  the  person's  control  (e.g.,  loss  of  employment,  a  business \\ndownturn,  unexpected  medical  emergency,  or  a  death,  divorce  or \\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. \\n\\n \\n\\nAG ¶ 20 (b) would apply if his divorce 11 years ago adversely affected his ability \\nto repay his debts. But he also has to act responsibly under the circumstances. It is his \\nburden  of  proof  to  submit  specific  documents  to  demonstrate  those  actions.  However, \\nhe failed to meet his burden of proof on that issue.  \\n\\n \\nLastly,  Applicant  contends  his  medical  problem  in  2010  caused  some  of  his \\ndelinquent debt. Applicant failed to prove AG ¶ 20 (b) applied because he did not submit \\nsufficient evidence of the conditions that he asserted were beyond his control and that \\nhe  acted  responsibly  in  resolving  his  delinquent  debts  during  the  time  the  debts  were \\naccumulating. \\n\\n \\n\\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \\n\\n \\nAG ¶ 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \\n \\nConduct  involving  questionable  judgment,  lack  of  candor,  dishonesty,  or \\nunwillingness  to  comply  with  rules  and  regulations  can  raise  questions \\nabout  an  individual's  reliability,  trustworthiness  and  ability  to  protect \\nclassified  information.  Of  special  interest  is  any  failure  to  provide  truthful \\nand  candid  answers  during  the  security  clearance  process  or  any  other \\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \\n \\nAG  ¶  16  describes  conditions  that  could  raise  a  security  concern  and  may  be \\n\\ndisqualifying: \\n\\n \\n (c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \\nnot  sufficient  for  an  adverse  determination  under  any  other  single \\nguideline,  but  which,  when  considered  as  a  whole,  supports  a  whole-\\nperson  assessment  of  questionable \\njudgment,  untrustworthiness, \\nunreliability,  lack  of  candor,  unwillingness  to  comply  with  rules  and \\nregulations,  or  other  characteristics  indicating  that  the  person  may  not \\nproperly safeguard protected information; \\n\\n \\n\\n5 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n\n",
       " \\n\\n(d)  credible  adverse  information  that  is  not  explicitly  covered  under  any \\nother  guideline  and  may  not  be  sufficient  by  itself  for  an  adverse \\ndetermination,  but  which,  when  combined  with  all  available  information \\nsupports  a  whole-person  assessment  of  questionable \\njudgment, \\nuntrustworthiness,  unreliability,  lack  of  candor,  unwillingness  to  comply \\nwith  rules  and  regulations,  or  other  characteristics  indicating  that  the \\nperson  may  not  properly  safeguard  protected  information.  This  includes \\nbut is not limited to consideration of: \\n \\n\\n(1)  untrustworthy  or  unreliable  behavior  to  include  breach  of  client \\nconfidentiality,  release  of  proprietary  information, unauthorized  release of \\nsensitive corporate or other government protected information: \\n \\n\\n(2)  disruptive,  violent,  or  other  inappropriate  behavior  in  the \\n\\nworkplace;  \\n \\n\\n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations;  \\n\\n \\n\\n(4)  evidence  of  significant  misuse  of  Government  or  other \\n\\nemployer's time or resources; and \\n \\n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \\nthat  creates  a  vulnerability  to  exploitation,  manipulation,  or  duress,  such \\nas  (1)  engaging  in  activities  which,  if  known,  may  affect  the  person's \\npersonal,  professional,  or  community  standing,  or  (2)  while  in  another \\ncountry,  engaging  in  any  activity  that  is  illegal  in  that  country  or  that  is \\nlegal  in  that  country  but  illegal  in  the  United  States  and  may  serve  as  a \\nbasis  for  exploitation  or  pressure  by  the  foreign  security  or  intelligence \\nservice or other group; \\n \\nApplicant  committed  numerous  acts  of  inappropriate  conduct  in  the  work  place, \\nexhibited  a pattern of dishonesty  and  rule  violations,  and  misused  his  employer’s  time \\nand resources to a significant degree, as shown by the continuing pattern of misconduct \\nfrom  2004  to  2014.  AG  ¶  16  (c)  and  (d)  apply  to  the  totality  of  Applicant’s  repeated \\nviolations and failure to conform his behavior to expected standards of conduct.  \\n\\n \\nApplicant’s  personal  conduct,  which  consists  of  a  number  repeated  and \\nsignificant  violations  of  company  policies,  creates  a  vulnerability  to  exploitation, \\nmanipulation, or duress because of the frequency and nature of the incidents. Coupled \\nwith his financial debts, Applicant is especially vulnerable to coercion and duress in the \\nhope of extricating himself from his predicament caused by his misconduct and financial \\ndelinquencies. AG ¶ 16 (e) is established.  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n6 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n\n",
       " \\n\\nAG  ¶  17  provides  seven  conditions  that  could  mitigate  security  concerns.  A \\nreview of each shows that none apply in this Applicant’s case. His offenses are a series \\nof  transgressions  that  show  an  inattention  to  the  requirements  of  his  position,  casting \\ndoubt  on  his  reliability,  trustworthiness,  and  good  judgment.  AG  ¶  17  (c)  is  not \\nestablished.  \\n \\n\\nApplicant has not acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change \\nhis actions or taken other positive steps to show his course of conduct will not recur. AG \\n¶ 17 (d) does not apply.  \\n \\n\\nApplicant  has  not  taken  positive  action  to  reduce  or  eliminate  vulnerability  to \\n\\nexploitation, manipulation, or duress. AG ¶ 17 (e) is not established.  \\n \\n\\nThe information is substantiated in many documents submitted in the Applicant’s \\n\\nfile. AG ¶ 17 (f) is not established.  \\n \\n\\nFinally, there is no allegation that Applicant associated with persons involved with \\ncriminal  activity,  so  AG  ¶17  (g)  is  not  applicable.  Nor  are  the  first  two  mitigating \\nconditions of any applicability because they apply to false statements by any Applicant \\nor failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \\n \\nWhole-Person Concept \\n\\n \\nUnder  the  whole-person  concept,  the  administrative  judge  must  evaluate  an \\napplicant=s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant=s \\nconduct  and  all  relevant  circumstances.  The  administrative  judge  should  consider  the \\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG & 2(a): \\n\\nthe  nature,  extent,  and  seriousness  of \\nto \\n\\n \\nthe \\nthe  conduct;  (2) \\n(1) \\ncircumstances  surrounding \\ninclude  knowledgeable \\nparticipation;  (3)  the  frequency  and  recency  of  the  conduct;  (4)  the \\nindividual=s  age  and  maturity  at  the  time  of  the  conduct;  (5)  the extent to \\nwhich  participation \\nthe  presence  or  absence  of \\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \\nfor  the  conduct;  (8)  the  potential  for  pressure,  coercion,  exploitation,  or \\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \\n \\n\\nthe  conduct, \\n\\nis  voluntary;  (6) \\n\\nUnder AG & 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \\nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.      \\n\\n \\n\\nI  considered  the  potentially  disqualifying  and  mitigating  conditions  in  light  of  all \\nfacts  and  circumstances  surrounding  this  case.  Applicant  was  an  adult  when  he \\nincurred  the  debts.  He  has  not  taken  any  action  supported  by  objective  evidence  to \\n\\n \\n\\n7 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n\n",
       " \\nresolve his delinquent debts. This inaction leaves him vulnerable to pressure, coercion, \\nexploitation,  or  duress  based  on  the  magnitude  of  his  financial  obligation.  His  lack  of \\naction continues to this day, and is obviously voluntary. His inaction will continue based \\non  his  past  performance.  Applicant  displayed  a  lack  of  good  judgment  incurring  the \\ndebts.  Next,  he  exhibited  a  continued  lack  of  appropriate  judgment  by  failing  to  make \\npayments on any of his delinquent debts during the past seven years. \\n\\n \\nApplicant also has a pattern of violations of work standards set by his employer. \\nHe is an inattentive employee who finds it difficult to conform his behavior to the rules \\nand regulations of his employer. His misconduct has been perpetrated over a decade of \\nemployment. \\n\\n \\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or substantial doubts as to \\nApplicant=s  eligibility  and  suitability  for  a  security  clearance.  For  all  these  reasons,  I \\nconclude  Applicant  did  not  mitigate  the  security  concerns  arising  under  the  guidelines \\nfor Financial Considerations and Personal Conduct.  \\n \\n\\nFormal Findings \\n\\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \\n\\n \\n \\nas required by ¶ E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \\n \\n\\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \\n\\n \\n          Subparagraph 1.a to 1.q: \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:   \\n\\nSubparagraphs 2.a to 2.j:   \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nAGAINST APPLICANT \\n\\nAgainst Applicant \\n\\nAGAINST APPLICANT \\n\\nAgainst Applicant \\n\\nConclusion \\n\\n \\n\\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \\nclearly  consistent  with  the  national  interest  to  grant  Applicant  eligibility  for  a  security \\nclearance.

DOD  CAF  acted  under  Executive \\nOrder  (EO)  10865,  Safeguarding  Classified  Information  within  Industry  (February  20, \\n1960),  as  amended;  DOD  Directive  5220.6,  Defense  Industrial  Personnel  Security \\nClearance  Review  Program  (January  2,  1992),  as  amended  (Directive);  and  the \\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on September 1, 2006. \\n\\n \\nApplicant  answered  the  SOR  on  July  14,  2015,  and  elected  to  have  his  case \\ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the \\nGovernment’s File of Relevant Material (FORM) on September 9, 2015. The evidence \\n\\n) \\n) \\n) \\n) \\n) \\n) \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n1 \\n \\n \\n\\n\f",
       "included in the FORM is identified as Items 4-10 and is admitted into the record (Items \\n1-3 are pleadings and transmittal documents). The FORM was mailed to Applicant, who \\nreceived it on October 19, 2015. Applicant was given an opportunity to file objections \\nand submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. He submitted an undated \\nresponse to the FORM, which was admitted without objection as Applicant Exhibit (AE) \\nA. The case was assigned to me on December 21, 2015.  \\n\\nIn Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted all but one of the allegations. The \\nadmissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a careful review of the pleadings and \\nevidence, I make the following additional findings of fact.1 \\n\\n \\nApplicant is 56 years old. He has worked for a defense contractor since 1997. He \\nis divorced and has three children, ages 15, 18, and 20. He has a bachelor’s degree. He \\nhas no military experience.2  \\n \\n \\n \\nApplicant’s conduct raised in the SOR included: a history of consuming alcohol, \\nat times, to excess from 1974 to about April 2014; being found guilty for operating under \\nthe  influence  of  alcohol  (OUI)  in  February  1991;  being  found  guilty  for  OUI  2nd  in \\nNovember 1997; and being found guilty for OUI 3rd in November 2010 (See SOR ¶¶ 1.a \\n- 1.d).3 \\n \\n \\nApplicant  began  drinking  alcohol  when  he  was  approximately  15  years  old  in \\n1974. He drinks beer on most occasions. Even after his OUI convictions, he stated he \\nwas  still  was  consuming  two  to  three  beers  a  week.  He  drinks  in  social  settings  and \\nafter hockey games. As a result of his 2010 OUI conviction, he lost his driver’s license \\nfor five years. He completed his probation in May 2015.4 \\n \\n \\nCourt documents establish that Applicant was found guilty of three OUI offenses, \\nin 1992 (1991 arrest), 2000 (1997 arrest), and 2012 (2010 arrest). He was placed on \\nprobation in each instance.5 \\n \\n \\nIn  February  1991,  Applicant  was  driving  home  from  a  friend’s  house  where  he \\nconsumed  about  four  beers.  He  was  stopped  by  a  police  officer  who  had  observed \\nApplicant’s  car  cross  over  the  center  line.  Applicant  was  given,  and  failed,  a  field \\nsobriety test. He was taken into the police station where he refused a breathalyzer test. \\n                                                           \\n1 Item 2. \\n \\n2 Item 4. \\n \\n3 Items 1, 3. \\n \\n4 Item 10; AE A. \\n \\n5 Item 7, 9; AE A. \\n \\n\\n \\n\\nFindings of Fact \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n2 \\n \\n \\n\\n\f",
       "He was charged with OUI and later pleaded guilty. He was required to attend 12 weeks \\nof alcohol education and counseling classes, which he completed.6 \\n \\n \\nIn November 1997, Applicant was going home from a high school football game \\nwhen he was stopped in traffic by a police officer. Applicant had two beers before the \\ngame  and  shared  a  flask  containing  some  kind  of  alcohol  at  the  game.  The  officer \\napparently  asked  Applicant \\nif  he  had  been  drinking  and  Applicant  answered \\naffirmatively. He was then given field sobriety tests, which he failed. He was arrested, \\ntaken back to the police station and given a breathalyzer test, which he also failed. He \\nwas  found  guilty  of  OUI  and  sentenced  to  two  years’  probation,  loss  of  his  driver’s \\nlicense  for  six  months,  and  12  weeks  required  attendance  at  alcohol  education  and \\ncounseling classes.7 \\n \\n \\nIn  November  2010,  Applicant  was  driving  back  from  a  hockey  tournament  and \\nwas stopped by a state patrolman because he crossed the center line. Applicant had \\nconsumed six beers and shared a flask of whiskey at the hockey tournament. He failed \\nthe  field  sobriety  tests  and  was  almost  incoherent  to  the  patrolman.  He  was  arrested \\nand taken to a police station where he was offered a breathalyzer test. He was unable \\nto properly perform the test, which was deemed a refusal to take the test. He was found \\nguilty of OUI and sentenced to six months’ incarceration, five years of probation, loss of \\ndriver’s  license  for  five  years,  and  mandatory  substance  abuse  evaluation  and \\ntreatment.8 \\n \\nThe court-ordered substance abuse treatment involved two mandatory sessions \\n \\nand  Applicant  voluntarily  attended  six  more  sessions.  He \\nto  provide \\ndocumentation of any evaluation done by the counselors, but Applicant stated he was \\ndiagnosed  as  being  an  alcohol  abuser.  Applicant  also  attended  Alcohol  Anonymous \\n(AA) meetings once every six to eight weeks. He last attended an AA meeting in May \\n2015. He continued to drink an occasional beer every few months. In May 2015, at an \\nAA meeting he heard a story had made him decide to stop drinking alcohol entirely. He \\nclaims he has not had any alcohol since that time.9 \\n \\n\\nfailed \\n\\nfor  a  security  clearance, \\n\\nWhen  evaluating  an  applicant’s  suitability \\n\\n \\nthe \\nadministrative  judge  must  consider  the  adjudicative  guidelines.  In  addition  to  brief \\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \\ndisqualifying  conditions  and  mitigating  conditions,  which  are  used  in  evaluating  an \\napplicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. \\n                                                           \\n6 Item 10. \\n \\n7 Item 10. \\n \\n8 Items 7, 10. \\n \\n9 Item 6-10; AE A. \\n \\n\\nPolicies \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n3 \\n \\n \\n\\n\f",
       "These  guidelines  are  not  inflexible  rules  of  law.  Instead,  recognizing  the \\ncomplexities  of  human  behavior,  these  guidelines  are  applied  in  conjunction  with  the \\nfactors  listed  in  the  adjudicative  process.  The  administrative  judge’s  overarching \\nadjudicative  goal  is  a  fair,  impartial,  and  commonsense  decision.  According  to  AG  ¶ \\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \\nthe  “whole-person  concept.”  The  administrative  judge  must  consider  all  available, \\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \\nmaking a decision. \\n\\n \\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) \\nrequires  that  “[a]ny  doubt  concerning  personnel  being  considered  for  access  to \\nclassified  information  will  be  resolved  in  favor  of  national  security.”  In  reaching  this \\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \\non the evidence contained in the record.  \\n\\n \\nUnder Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \\ncontroverted  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  Under  Directive  ¶  E3.1.15,  an  “applicant  is \\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \\nmitigate  facts  admitted  by  applicant  or  proven  by  Department  Counsel,  and  has  the \\nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.”  \\n\\nthe  Government  predicated  upon \\n\\n \\nA  person  who  seeks  access  to  classified  information  enters  into  a  fiduciary \\nrelationship  with \\ntrust  and  confidence.  This \\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \\nGovernment  reposes  a  high  degree  of  trust  and  confidence  in  individuals  to  whom  it \\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \\nthe  possible  risk  that  an  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  safeguard \\nclassified  information.  Such  decisions  entail  a  certain  degree  of  legally  permissible \\nextrapolation  about  potential,  rather  than  actual,  risk  of  compromise  of  classified \\ninformation. \\n\\n \\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of \\nthe national interest and shall  in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \\napplicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \\n\\nAnalysis \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \\n\\nAG ¶ 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption: \\n\\nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \\njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \\nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \\n\\n \\n4 \\n \\n \\n\\n\f",
       "AG  ¶  22  describes  conditions  that  could  raise  a  security  concern  and  may  be \\n\\ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \\n\\n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \\nthe  influence,  fighting,  child  or  spouse  abuse,  disturbing  the  peace,  or \\nother  incidents  of  concern,  regardless  of  whether  the  individual  is \\ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent;  \\n\\n(c)  habitual  or  binge  consumption  of  alcohol  to  the  point  of  impaired \\njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol \\nabuser or alcohol dependent. \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\nof both disqualifying conditions.  \\n\\nApplicant’s three OUI convictions and his drinking history support the application \\n\\nI  have  also  considered  all  of  the  mitigating  conditions  for  alcohol  consumption \\n\\nunder AG ¶ 23 and found the following relevant: \\n\\n(a)  so  much  time  has  passed,  or  the  behavior  was  so  infrequent,  or  it \\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \\nor good judgment; and \\n\\n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol \\nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \\nhas  established  a  pattern  of  abstinence  (if  alcohol  dependent)  or \\nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser). \\n\\n \\nApplicant’s  last  adverse  alcohol  incident  occurred  in  November  2010  and  he \\ncame  off  probation  for  that  offense  in  May  2015.  His  three  OUI  convictions  are  not \\ninfrequent  under  these  circumstances.  Insufficient  attenuation  exists  to  conclude \\nenough  time  has  passed  since  his  last  alcohol-related  incident.  His  history  of  OUI \\narrests  and  convictions  under  similar  circumstances  suggest  that  recurrence  is  a \\npossibility. His current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment are in doubt. AG ¶ \\n23(a) does not apply. \\n \\nApplicant recently decided to totally abstain from using alcohol. He indicated that \\n \\nhe has abstained since May 2015. While this is a commendable start, it is too soon to \\ndetermine whether his abstinence will continue to be part of his life or whether he will \\nuse alcohol responsibly in the future. AG ¶ 23(b) partially applies.   \\n \\nWhole-Person Concept \\n \\nUnder  the  whole-person  concept,  the  administrative  judge  must  evaluate  an \\n \\napplicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s \\n\\n \\n5 \\n \\n \\n\\n\f",
       "conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  \\n \\n\\nthe  conduct, \\n\\nthe  nature,  extent,  and  seriousness  of \\nto \\n\\n(1) \\nthe  conduct;  (2) \\nthe \\ncircumstances  surrounding \\ninclude  knowledgeable \\nparticipation;  (3)  the  frequency  and  recency  of  the  conduct;  (4)  the \\nindividual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \\nwhich  participation \\nthe  presence  or  absence  of \\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \\nfor  the  conduct;  (8)  the  potential  for  pressure,  coercion,  exploitation,  or \\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \\n \\n\\nis  voluntary;  (6) \\n\\nUnder AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \\nof the guideline and the whole-person concept.        \\n\\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered the circumstances that \\nled  to  his  arrests  and  his  current  state  of  abstinence.  Overall,  the  record  evidence \\nleaves  me  with  questions  and  doubts  as  to  Applicant’s  eligibility  and  suitability  for  a \\nsecurity  clearance.  For  all  these  reasons,  I  conclude  Applicant  failed  to  mitigate  the \\nsecurity concerns under Guideline G. \\n\\nFormal Findings \\n\\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \\n\\n \\n \\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \\n \\n \\n \\n\\nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.d: \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nAgainst Applicant \\n\\nAGAINST APPLICANT \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nConclusion \\n\\n \\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \\nclearly  consistent  with  the  national  interest  to  grant  Applicant  eligibility  for  a  security \\nclearance.

The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \\n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \\n1992),  as  amended  (Directive);  and  the  adjudicative  guidelines  (AG)  implemented  by \\nthe DOD on September 1, 2006. \\n\\n \\nApplicant  responded  to  the  SOR  on  November  14,  2014,  and  requested  a \\nhearing  before  an  administrative  judge.  The  case  was  originally  assigned  to  me  on \\nFebruary 27, 2015. Scheduling of the case was delayed because Applicant was working \\noverseas. The case was reassigned to me on May 4, 2015. After coordinating with the \\nparties, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n1 \\n\\n\f",
       "on  July  16,  2015,  scheduling  the  hearing  for  August  18,  2015.  The  hearing  was \\nconvened  as  scheduled.  DOHA  received  the  hearing  transcript  (Tr.)  on  August  26, \\n2015.  \\n \\n\\nEvidentiary Rulings \\n\\nGovernment  Exhibits  (GE)  1,  2,  4,  5,  and  6  were  admitted  in  evidence  without \\nobjection. GE 3 was admitted over Applicant’s objection. Applicant testified, called five \\nwitnesses, and submitted Applicant’s Exhibits (AE) A through Z, which were admitted \\nwithout  objection.  The  record  was  held  open  for  Applicant  to  submit  additional \\ninformation. He submitted documents that I have marked AE AA and BB1 and admitted \\nwithout objection.  \\n \\n\\nFindings of Fact \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\nApplicant is a 57-year-old self-employed contractor for a defense contractor. He \\nserved  in  the  U.S.  military  from  1979  until  he  retired  in  2000.  He  seeks  to  retain  a \\nsecurity clearance, which he has held since he was in the military. He attended college \\nfor a period, but he is a few credits shy of a degree. His first marriage ended in divorce. \\nHe has been married to his current spouse for more than 25 years. He has two adult \\nchildren.2 \\n \\n \\nApplicant spent the majority of his military career in special operations. He went \\non  numerous  combat  missions,  conducted  clandestine  insertions,  and  operated \\nundercover.  When  he  retired  he  became  an  entrepreneur  and  started  his  own \\ncompanies.  His  primary  company  was  incorporated,  but  Applicant  had  to  personally \\nguarantee many of the company’s liabilities. He also invested in real estate. His primary \\ncompany  suffered  significant  setbacks  during  the  recession  and  housing  crisis  of  the \\nlater part of the 2000s. His real estate properties lost much of their value. He closed his \\nprimary  company  in  2009  and  has  been  working  since  then  as  a  self-employed \\ncontractor and subcontractor for other companies. He has spent much of the last five \\nyears working overseas in dangerous assignments.3 \\n \\n  \\nThe SOR alleges nine delinquent debts, which include a $58,161 judgment (SOR \\n¶  1.a),  mortgage  loans  (SOR  ¶  1.c  -  $30,994;  SOR  ¶  1.d  -  $351,562;  SOR  ¶  1.e  - \\n$271,900; and SOR ¶ 1.f - $50,688), two business-related debts (SOR ¶ 1.b - $18,028 \\nand SOR ¶ 1.h - $77,115) and federal taxes (SOR ¶ 1.g - $33,882 for tax year 2008, \\nand SOR ¶ 1.i – no amount alleged for tax years 2012 and 2013).

       " \\nApplicant’s primary company was growing, and it leased a larger warehouse in \\nabout  2008.  The  business  ultimately  failed,  and  the  company  broke  the  lease.  The \\nowner of the warehouse sued  Applicant  personally  and  obtained a $58,161 judgment \\nagainst  him  (SOR  ¶  1.a).  Applicant’s  attorney  is  negotiating  a  settlement  on  this \\njudgment.4  \\n \\n \\nApplicant and a partner had a falling out over the business. The ex-partner sued \\nApplicant  for  $160,000.  They  reached  a  settlement  through  arbitration  in  which \\nApplicant agreed to pay the ex-partner $163,000 by 2010. He paid about $86,000, but \\nhe  was  unable  to  pay  the  remainder  when  the  company  closed.  The  partner  either \\nobtained  a  judgment  for  $77,000  or  sought  to  enforce  the  arbitrated  settlement. \\nApplicant’s  attorney  is  negotiating  a  settlement  for  the  remainder  owed  to  the  ex-\\npartner.5 \\n \\nIn February 2013, Applicant settled the $20,302 business credit card debt alleged \\n \\nin  SOR  ¶  1.b  (alleged  as  $18,028  in  SOR)  for  $10,151,  which  was  paid  in  February \\n2013.

The IRS filed a $33,882 tax lien against Applicant in June 2010 \\n(SOR ¶ 1.g). In January 2011, the IRS applied his $15,892 refund from his 2007 taxes \\nto his 2008 taxes. Applicant paid the remaining $5,689 owed for 2008 in January 2013. \\nThe  2014  credit  reports  obtained  by  the  Government  report  the  lien  as  released  in \\nJanuary 2013.7 \\n \\n \\nApplicant owed the IRS $65,863 for his 2012 and 2013 federal income taxes. In \\nApril  2015,  he  submitted  a  proposed  installment  agreement  to  the  IRS  whereby  he \\nwould  pay  an  initial  $915  and  then  $500  per  month  until  paid.  In  July  2015,  the  IRS \\naccepted  Applicant’s  installment  agreement  and  added  his  2014  taxes.  On  June  5, \\n2015,  Applicant  paid  the  IRS  $56,415  for  his  2014  taxes.  On  July  9,  2015,  he  paid \\n$10,000 toward his estimated taxes for 2015.8 \\n \\n \\nApplicant used to own five properties consisting of his residence and four rental \\nproperties. Some of his tenants did not pay their rent, and he also had a property vacant \\nfor an extended period. Applicant bought his home and another property when he was \\nin the military. He still has those properties, plus another, but he lost two properties to \\nforeclosure.

The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \\n\\n \\n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \\n\\n \\n\\n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\nevidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions.  \\n \\n  \\nprovided under AG ¶ 20.

Additionally, the SOR alleged the high credit on the two \\nmortgage  loans  (SOR  ¶¶  1.d  -  $351,562  and  1.e  -  $271,900),  when  the  balances  on \\nthose loans were reported as zero.  \\n \\n  \\nApplicant paid his 2008 federal income taxes. He has a payment plan in place for \\nhis  2012  and  2013  tax  years.  He  settled  and  paid  the  second  mortgage  loan  on  his \\nhome,  and  he  paid  other  debts  that  were  not  alleged  in  the  SOR.  His  attorney  is \\nnegotiating  settlements  for  the  two  judgments  against  him.  Applicant  credibly  testified \\nthat it will take time, but he is committed to resolving all his debts. \\n \\n \\nI find that Applicant established a plan to resolve his financial problems, and he \\ntook significant action to implement that plan. He acted responsibly and made a good-\\nfaith effort to pay his debts. There are clear indications that his financial problems are \\nbeing  resolved  and  are  under  control.  They  occurred  under  circumstances  that  are \\nunlikely  to  recur  and  do  not  cast  doubt  on  his  current  reliability,  trustworthiness,  and \\ngood judgment.

       " \\nUnder AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \\nsecurity  clearance  must  be  an  overall  commonsense  judgment  based  upon  careful \\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \\n \\n\\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions  in  light  of  all \\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \\nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis.  \\n\\n \\nApplicant’s  character  evidence  was  extraordinary.  His  financial  problems  are \\nlarge, but not insurmountable. Applicant credibly testified that he will eventually resolve \\nall his debts.

Applicant had no \\nobjection to the amendment. The motion to amend was granted.2 \\n \\n\\nFindings of Fact \\n\\n \\n \\nApplicant is a 40-year-old mechanic who works as a quality assurance inspector \\nfor  a  defense  contractor.  He  has  been  working  for  that  contractor  in  the  Middle  East \\nsince May 2011 and has worked overseas for other defense contractors for a number of \\nyears.  He  earned  a  general  educational  development  certificate  in  1996  and  an \\nassociate’s degree in 2003. He has been married twice. He married his current wife in \\n2005. He has three children, ages 15, 16, and 22.3 \\n \\n\\nExcluding  the  withdrawn  allegations,  the  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  had  three \\ndelinquent  debts  totaling  $64,168  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.c).  In  his  Answer  to  the  SOR,  he \\ndenied each debt. Substantial evidence of the alleged debts is contained in GE 1-4.4  \\n\\n \\nIn 1999, Applicant was involved in a car accident and incurred a broken pelvis \\nand hip. He was determined to be fully disabled and collected about $1,000 per month \\nin disability payments from the Social Security Administration (SSA). While receiving the \\ndisability benefits, he knew there was a limit on how much income he could earn, but \\ndid not know the exact restrictions. In 2006, he received a letter from SSA that indicated \\n                                                           \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n1 Tr. 23-25.  \\n\\n2 Tr. 43-44.  \\n\\n3 Tr. 5-7, 23, 37-39, 42-43; GE 1. \\n\\n4 GE 1-4; Applicant’s Answer to the SOR.  \\n\\n \\n2 \\n \\n \\n\\n\f",
       "he was earning more income than he was allowed. At that time, his disability payments \\nstopped, and he has not received any further disability payments since then.5 \\n\\n \\nA credit report dated June 12, 2010, reflected that Applicant’s SSA account had \\nbeen  placed  for  collection  in  the  amount  of  $20,955  (SOR  ¶  1.c).  This  delinquent \\naccount was the result of his overpayment of disability payments. In 2008, he started \\nrepaying this debt through a monthly pay allotment of $300. When he left his job later \\nthat year, the allotment stopped. In 2012, the SSA began garnishing his pay at a rate of \\n$600 every two weeks. By early 2014 (well before the issuance of the SOR), he fully \\nrepaid this debt. In July 2014, he received a letter from the SSA stating he overpaid the \\ndebt and would be receiving a refund of $2,535.6 \\n\\n \\nIn 2008 and 2009, Applicant worked overseas, and a portion of his income was \\nexempt from taxation. In those years, his income was greater than the exemption, and \\nhe incurred taxes that he could not pay. In his security clearance application (SCA), he \\ndisclosed that he owed approximately $36,000 to the IRS for 2008 and 2009 (SOR ¶ \\n1.b). In 2010, his state also filed a $7,213 tax lien against him (SOR ¶ 1.a).7 \\n\\n \\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant stated that the state tax lien had been repaid \\nthrough monthly payroll deductions. He also stated that he had a repayment plan with \\nthe IRS and the payments are automatically deducted from his pay.8  \\n\\n  \\nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that the state tax lien was repaid, but he had \\nnot  yet  received  a  document  from  the  state  showing  it  was  paid.  He  stated  that  the \\ndeductions from his pay for the state tax lien stopped over a year ago. At the hearing, \\nhe also provided IRS account transcripts for 2008 and 2009 that showed he had been \\nconsistently  making  monthly  payments  of  $375  since  August  2012.  As  of  September \\n2015,  his  IRS  account  balance  for  2008  was  $3,961  and  for  2009  was  $17,124.  The \\naccount transcripts showed that his IRS debt had been cut almost in half.9 \\n\\n  \\nBesides the debts alleged in the SOR, Applicant’s credit report dated March 26, \\n2015, reflected that he had no other delinquent debts. He also testified that he had no \\nother delinquent debts. In 2014, he earned about $108,000 and his wife earned about \\n$25,000. In his post-hearing submission, Applicant presented letters from the state that \\nreflected he did not have an outstanding tax liability for 2008 and 2009.10 \\n\\n                                                           \\n\\n5 Tr. 26-29; GE 1. \\n \\n6 Tr. 29-32; GE 1-3; AE C. \\n \\n7 Tr. 32-36; GE 1.    \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n8 Applicant’s Answer to the SOR. \\n\\n9 Tr. 32-36, 46-51; AE D-F. \\n\\n10 Tr. 39-42; AE A, B, H, I; Applicant’s Answer to the SOR. \\n\\n \\n3 \\n \\n \\n\\n\f",
       "Policies \\n\\n \\n\\nThe  President  of  the  United  States  has  the  authority  to  control  access  to \\ninformation  bearing  on  national  security  and  to  determine  whether  an  individual  is \\nsufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. Department of the Navy v. \\nEgan,  484  U.S.  518,  527  (1988).  The  President  has  authorized  the  Secretary  of \\nDefense to grant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it \\nis clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \\nClassified  Information  within  Industry  §  2  (Feb.  20,  1960),  as  amended.  The  U.S. \\nSupreme  Court  has  recognized  the  substantial  discretion  of  the  Executive  Branch  in \\nregulating  access  to  information  pertaining  to  national  security,  emphasizing  that  “no \\none  has  a  ‘right’  to  a  security  clearance.”  Department  of  the  Navy  v.  Egan,  484  U.S. \\n518, 528 (1988). \\n\\n \\nEligibility  for  a  security  clearance  is  predicated  upon  the  applicant  meeting  the \\ncriteria  contained  in  the  adjudicative  guidelines.  These  AGs  are  not  inflexible  rules  of \\nlaw.  Instead,  recognizing  the  complexities  of  human  behavior,  these  guidelines  are \\napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s \\nadjudicative  goal  is  a  fair,  impartial,  and  commonsense  decision.  An  administrative \\njudge  must  consider  all  available,  reliable  information  about  the  person,  past  and \\npresent, favorable and unfavorable, in reaching a decision.  \\n\\n \\nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \\naccess  to  classified  information.  This  relationship  transcends  normal  duty  hours  and \\nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \\npossible  risk  that  the  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  safeguard \\nclassified  information.  Such  decisions  entail  a  certain  degree  of  legally  permissible \\nextrapolation  of  potential,  rather  than  actual,  risk  of  compromise  of  classified \\ninformation. Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in \\nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. \\nOr.  10865  §  7.  See  also  Executive  Order  12968  (Aug.  2,  1995),  Section  3.  Thus,  a \\nclearance  decision  is  merely  an  indication  that  the  Applicant  has  or  has  not  met  the \\nstrict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing \\na clearance. \\n\\n \\nInitially,  the  Government  must  establish,  by  substantial  evidence,  conditions  in \\nthe  personal  or  professional  history  of  the  applicant  that  may  disqualify  the  applicant \\nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \\nof  establishing  controverted  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  See  Egan,  484  U.S.  at  531.  \\n“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. \\nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \\npresume  a  nexus  or  rational  connection  between  proven  conduct  under  any  of  the \\ncriteria listed and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \\n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n4 \\n \\n \\n\\n\f",
       "Once  the  Government  establishes  a  disqualifying  condition  by  substantial \\nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \\nfacts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \\nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue [his or her] security \\nclearance.”  ISCR  Case  No.  01-20700  at  3  (App.  Bd.  Dec.  19,  2002).  The  burden  of \\ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. \\n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \\nif they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   \\n\\nAnalysis \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \\n\\n \\nThe security concern for this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 18 as follows: \\n\\n \\n\\nFailure  or  inability  to  live  within  one’s  means,  satisfy  debts,  and  meet \\nfinancial  obligations  may  indicate  poor  self-control,  lack  of  judgment,  or \\nunwillingness  to  abide  by  rules  and  regulations,  all  of  which  can  raise \\nquestions  about  an  individual’s  reliability,  trustworthiness  and  ability  to \\nprotect  classified \\nfinancially \\noverextended  is  at  risk  of  having  to  engage  in  illegal  acts  to  generate \\nfunds.  \\n \\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \\n\\ninformation.

AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) apply in \\nthis case. \\n \\n \\napplicable:  \\n \\n\\nFour financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially \\n\\n(a)  the  behavior  happened  so  long  ago,  was  so  infrequent,  or  occurred \\nunder  such  circumstances  that  it  is  unlikely  to  recur  and  does  not  cast \\ndoubt  on  the  individual’s  current  reliability,  trustworthiness,  or  good \\njudgment; \\n \\n(b)  the  conditions  that  resulted  in  the  financial  problem  were  largely \\nbeyond  the  person’s  control  (e.g.,  loss  of  employment,  a  business \\ndownturn,  unexpected  medical  emergency,  or  a  death,  divorce  or \\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \\n\\n \\n5 \\n \\n \\n\\n\f",
       "(c)  the  person  has  received  or  is  receiving  counseling  for  the  problem \\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \\nunder control; and \\n \\n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \\notherwise resolve debts.  \\n \\nApplicant  incurred  delinquent  debts  because  he  continued  to  receive  disability \\nbenefits  after  his  income  exceeded  earning  limitations  and  because  he  failed  to  pay \\ntaxes  on  income  earned  in  2008  and  2009.  These  events  do  not  constitute \\ncircumstances beyond his control. AG ¶ 20(b) does not apply. \\n\\n \\nApplicant  has  resolved  the  state  tax  lien  in  SOR  ¶  1.a  and  the  disability \\noverpayment  in  SOR  ¶  1.c.  He  has  established  a  repayment  plan  to  resolve  the \\ndelinquent  federal  taxes  in  SOR  ¶  1.b.  He  has  been  consistently  making  payments \\nunder  that  plan  for  the  past  three  years.  The  record  established  that  his  financial \\nproblems  are  under  control  and  are  being  resolved.  He  has  not  incurred  any  recent \\ndelinquent debts. His financial problems are unlikely to recur and do not cast doubt on \\nhis current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.

Mendez, Esq., Department Counsel \\n\\nFor Applicant: Mark S. Zaid, Esq. \\n\\n \\n\\nHARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: \\n \\nApplicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) alleges two allegations under Guideline \\n \\nK  (handling  protected  information)  and  five  allegations  under  Guideline  E  (personal \\nconduct).  All  allegations  relate  to  his  handling  of  confidential  data  in  December  2007 \\nand January 2008 and his participation in the follow-up investigation in 2009 and 2010. \\nApplicant was assured that “trusted downloads” provided by the Navy and Company L \\ndid not contain classified information, when two of them contained a mix of unclassified \\nand  classified  information.  Applicant  and  his  team  members  transferred  the  trusted \\ndownloads onto computers that were for unclassified use only. There was no evidence \\nthat any of the classified information was viewed by anyone not authorized to view it. \\nApplicant made some judgment errors in his reaction to the discovery of the classified \\ninformation. In March 2008, Applicant’s attorney offered to provide requested materials \\nto the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI); Applicant cooperated with the investigation; \\nand  Applicant’s  errors  in  judgment  are  not  recent.  He  credibly  assured  conscientious \\ncompliance with security rules. He presented a strong case of whole-person mitigation. \\nSecurity concerns are mitigated. Access to classified information is granted.      \\n  \\n\\nHistory of the Case \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nOn  February  11,  2011,  Applicant  completed  and  signed  an  Electronic \\nQuestionnaires  for  Investigations  Processing  (e-QIP)  (SF  86).  (Government  Exhibit \\n(GE)  1)  On  August  18,  2014,  the  Department  of  Defense  (DOD)  Consolidated \\nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued an SOR to Applicant pursuant to Executive Order \\n\\n \\n1 \\n                                         \\n \\n\\n\f",

Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February \\n20, 1960, as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \\nClearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended; and the \\nadjudicative guidelines (AG), which became effective on September 1, 2006. \\n\\n \\nThe  SOR  detailed  reasons  why  the  DOD  CAF  could  not  make  the  affirmative \\nfinding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \\nor  continue  a  security  clearance  for  Applicant  and  recommended  referral  to  an \\nadministrative  judge  to  determine  whether  a  clearance  should  be  granted,  continued, \\ndenied,  or  revoked.  (Hearing  Exhibit  (HE)  2)  Specifically,  the  SOR  set  forth  security \\nconcerns arising under Guidelines K and E.   \\n\\n  \\nOn  September  2,  2014,  Applicant  responded  to  the  SOR,  and  he  requested  a \\nhearing.  On  July  23,  2015,  Department  Counsel  was  ready  to  proceed.  On  July  30, \\n2015,  the  case  was  assigned  to  me.  On  November  12,  2015,  the  Defense  Office  of \\nHearings  and  Appeals  (DOHA)  issued  a  notice  of  hearing,  setting  the  hearing  for \\nDecember 14, 2015. (HE 1) The hearing was held as scheduled. On December 7, 2015, \\nDepartment  Counsel  moved  to  amend  the  allegation  in  SOR  ¶  1.b.  There  was  no \\nobjection,  and  I  granted  the  motion.  During  the  hearing,  Department  Counsel  offered \\nseven  exhibits,  which  were  admitted  into  evidence  without  objection,  and  Applicant \\noffered  18  exhibits,  which  were  admitted  without  objection.  (Transcript  (Tr.)  17-21; \\nGovernment  Exhibit  (GE)  1-7;  Applicant  Exhibit  (AE)  A-R)  On  December  22,  2015,  I \\nreceived a transcript of the hearing.   \\n\\n  \\n\\nFindings of Fact \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nIn  Applicant’s  SOR  response,  he  denied  all  of  the  SOR  allegations.  Applicant \\nadmitted the information in amended SOR ¶ 1.b. Applicant’s admissions are accepted \\nas findings of fact.  \\n \\n\\nApplicant is a 56-year-old software engineer employed by Company D, a defense \\ncontractor from 1980 to 2007. (Tr. 179, 214; AE A) From 2008 to present, he has been \\nemployed by another defense contractor. (AE A) In January 2011, Applicant’s security \\nclearance was suspended. (GE 2; AE E)  \\n\\n \\nIn 1998, Applicant married. (Tr. 235) His spouse is a missile engineer, and she \\nhas a security clearance. (Tr. 216) He has two daughters who are 14 and 15. (Tr. 215) \\nHis  father  was  a  career  Navy  officer.  (Tr.  215)  His  two  older  brothers  served  in  the \\nNavy. (Tr. 215) His nephew was a Navy Seal, who served three tours in Afghanistan. \\n(Tr. 215) Applicant never served in the military. (Tr. 235) \\n\\n \\nCompany D funded Applicant’s college tuition, and in 1982, Applicant received a \\nbachelor  of  science  degree  in  mathematics.  (Tr.  178-179,  235;  AE  A)  After  1982, \\nApplicant worked on a variety of Navy contracts for Company D.  Sometimes he was \\nemployed at Company D, but detailed to work on Company L managed projects. (Tr. \\n180) During Desert Shield, he was deployed for six months to the Persian Gulf aboard a \\nU.S. Navy vessel. (Tr. 180) \\n\\n \\n2 \\n                                         \\n \\n\\n\f",
       "In 1999, Applicant was one of the architects of a program for a simulation test of \\npart of a weapons system developed by Company L by utilizing unclassified data. (Tr. \\n184;  GE  5;  GE  6)  From  1999  to  2007,  Applicant  was  instrumental  in  the  program \\ndevelopment. (Tr. 184-189). In November 2007, Applicant went to the Pentagon, and in \\nthe  presence  of  an  admiral,  was  shown  some  design  charts,  which  Applicant  had \\ndeveloped on behalf of Company D, and Company L had previously presented without \\nauthorization to the Navy. (Tr. 189) Applicant believed the information was improperly \\ntaken from Company D by Company L.  \\n\\n \\n\\nHandling Protected Information and Personal Conduct1  \\n\\n \\nApplicant was the leader of a team of technicians working on a Navy project. (Tr. \\n99; GE 5 at 1-2) On about 75 occasions over several years, Company L employees or \\nNavy personnel provided “trusted downloads” on flash drives or compact discs, which \\nwere supposed to be unclassified data or software that Applicant and his team could \\nuse  for  analysis.  (Tr.  94,  99-103;  GE  6  at  7)  Technicians  were  concerned  that  a  file \\nmarked  unclassified  might  actually  contain  classified  data.  (Tr.  87)  The  only  way \\nclassified information could be placed on unclassified computers was through an error \\nin  the  trusted-download  process,  or  a  deliberate  improper  transfer  of  classified \\ninformation. (Tr. 78) Applicant was not authorized to make a trusted download, and he \\ndenied knowingly transferring classified information to an unclassified computer. (Tr. 78)  \\nThere are eight or nine people that could have been responsible for entering data that \\nwas too close to the thresholds to be unclassified. (Tr. 214) \\n\\n \\nApplicant’s team’s project utilized a classified version and an unclassified version \\nof a computer program. The classified version used “a set of parameters, thresholds, \\nwhich [were] put together along with the executable part of the program” to generate a \\n“classified  result.”  (Tr.  100,  107)  The  classified  numbers  changed  as  the  project \\nadvanced.  (Tr.  122-123)  M  was  a  key  person  in  deciding  whether  data  should  be \\nclassified or not. (Tr. 128) The unclassified version of the program used numbers that \\nwere not representative of the real system to simulate interactions, which allowed use of \\nlaptops and communications in an unclassified environment and improved productivity. \\n(Tr. 100-101, 107) The non-representative numbers were used “to test the mechanics of \\nthe  program”  and  debug  problems  in  an  unclassified  environment.  (Tr.  108)  The \\nclassified numbers were not supposed to be used on unclassified computers. (Tr. 112) \\nM assumed the computer he was issued was from Company L and not from DOD. (Tr. \\n113) The unclassified versions could be used at home. (Tr. 100-102) Employees were \\nallowed to use company-issued computers for some personal use; however, extensive \\npersonal use was discouraged. (Tr. 124) At Company L, if a spillage was discovered, \\nCompany L’s facility security officer (FSO) was supposed to be notified. (Tr. 115) The \\nFSO was responsible for ensuring the file was deleted from computers. (Tr. 116) After \\ndeletion of the file, security used a cleaning program to scramble the computer memory. \\n\\n                                            \\n\\n1Unless stated otherwise, the source for the information in this section is a December 16, 2010, \\nletter from an FBI special agent written to the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) about \\nthe investigation of Applicant for unauthorized removal and retention of classified documents or material \\nin possible violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1924. (GE 3)   \\n\\n \\n3 \\n                                         \\n \\n\\n\f",
       "(Tr.  116)  Applicant  had  access  to  classified  versions  of  the  program  and  classified \\nprogram data. (Tr. 118) \\n\\n \\nEmployees  of  Companies  D  and  L  sought  to  maintain  separation  between  the \\nclassified  and  unclassified  versions.  (Tr.  101,  106-108)  In  2008,  the  security  people \\ninterviewed employees and borrowed computers with the programs on their computers \\nto check for a data spill. (Tr. 102) Security found files containing classified information \\non the computers of four to seven employees of Company L, including on M’s computer. \\n(Tr.  102-103,  118-121)  Security  performed  cleansing  operations  on  the  computers  to \\neliminate  the  files  with  classified  information.  (Tr.  102-103,  118-121)  Because  of  the \\nspillage,  the  whole  unclassified-simulation  program  was  terminated,  and  all  future \\nsimulation work was done on the classified side. (Tr. 119, 124) Team members worked \\non  different  areas  of  the  program.  (Tr.  104-105)  Their  work  would  be  subsequently \\nmerged,  which  could  cause  classified  data  to  be  unknowingly  transferred  from  one \\ncomputer to another, and no one would know the origin of the classified information. (Tr. \\n104-105)      \\n\\n \\n4 \\n                                         \\n \\n\\n \\nIn December 2007, Applicant received a trusted download onto a flash drive from \\nthe  Navy  for  evaluation  of  Applicant  and  his  team.  (Tr.  221;  GE  5;  GE  6)  The \\ninformation was supposed to unclassified. Classified files from downloads were labeled \\nwith a C, and unclassified files from trusted downloads were labeled with a T for test. \\n(Tr. 192) In December 2007, B, a GS-13, who was the senior Navy employee on the \\nteam,  was  at  Applicant’s  residence,  when  they  were  doing  some computer  work.  (Tr. \\n92, 192) Applicant inserted a flash drive into B’s laptop computer and was surprised to \\nsee a file starting with a C, which meant the file could be classified. (Tr. 193, 217-218; \\nGE 5 at 2) Applicant had previously transferred the data from the flash drive to his DOD-\\nissued laptop computer without noticing the C-file. (Tr. 217) Applicant and B reviewed \\nthe content of the C-file and determined it was too “inchoate” and lacked a specification \\nto  be  classified.  (Tr.  193)  Nothing  inside  the  C-file  was  marked  classified,  and  the \\ncontent of the C-file never made it into a specification. (Tr. 193-194)  \\n\\n \\nIn  December  2007,  the  information  from  the  flash  drive  would  have  been \\nclassified; however, by 2015, it was clear that at most it was sensitive information. (Tr. \\n194, 220; GE 5 at 2) In 2007, the classification level for the data found on Applicant’s \\ncomputer  was  probably  confidential.  (GE  6 at  4)  B  and  Applicant  agreed  that  the file \\nshould be deleted, and B suggested that Applicant download a cleaning program to be \\nsure  it  was  deleted.  (Tr.  193;  GE  4  at  2;  GE  6  at  2)  They  deleted  the  file.  (Tr.  162) \\nApplicant obtained a cleaning program, which wipes out inactive files. (Tr. 195-196)2 It \\ndeletes files from the recycle bin. (Tr. 224) Applicant conceded it was bad judgment to \\ndelete  the  file  without  going  to  security.  (Tr.  195,  235)  Applicant  has  never  had  any \\nsecurity violations. (Tr. 195) Applicant did not disclose the possible transfer of classified \\ninformation  to  an  unclassified  system  until  August  19,  2010  when  he  met  with  an \\n                                            \\n\\n2Applicant is not the only team member with a clearing program on his DOD-issued computer. C \\nhas a cleaning or deletion program on his computer. (Tr. 80) C understood that if classified information \\nwere  found  on  an  unclassified  computer  the  safest  reaction  is  to  delete  the  classified  information  to \\nensure its protection from loss or compromise. (Tr. 80-81) The spillage should  also be reported  to the \\nFSO. (Tr. 85-86) \\n\\n\f",
       "Assistant U.S. Attorney (AUSA) and others for a proffer session. Applicant promised to \\nreport any spillage that occurs immediately to his company (FSO). (Tr. 214)   \\n\\n \\nOn January 18, 2008, two employees of a rival defense contractor (Company L) \\ntold investigators that Applicant may be responsible for the unauthorized removal and \\nretention of classified materials. (GE 4) \\n\\n \\nOn  January  28,  2008,  Company  D’s  FSO  called  Applicant  and  asked  him  to \\nprovide his two DOD-issued laptop computers to Company L. (Tr. 196, 229) One of the \\nrequested laptop computers was at Applicant’s home. (Tr. 197-199) The FSO did not \\nexplain why the computers were requested. (Tr. 199) Applicant said he would bring the \\ncomputers the next day, and the FSO did not insist or demand that Applicant provide \\nthe computer sooner. (GE 6 at 6) Applicant did not believe there had been classified \\ninformation on the laptop computers. (Tr. 200) Applicant said he deleted  some family \\npictures and other personal information that he did not want to release. (Tr. 139-140, \\n162-163,  169-170,  202,  227-229)  On  January  29,  2008,  Applicant  turned  in  the  two \\nlaptop computers. (GE 6 at 2) \\n\\n \\nIn  early  February  2008,  Applicant  went  to  another  state  where  there  was  a \\ncomputer  with  the  same  program.  Two  subject  matter  experts  (SMEs),  who  were \\nassociated with Applicant’s team, reviewed the “unclassified data” on the hard drive and \\ndetermined  that  there was  probably  classified  data  on  the  computer.  (Tr.  76-77,  205, \\n213;  GE  6  at  2-3)  Most  of  the  information  was  unclassified;  however,  the  classified \\ninformation  was  one  table  of  numbers  or  parameters,  and  none  of  the  SMEs  were \\naware  of  how  the  classified  table  had  migrated  from  the  classified  system  to  the \\nunclassified  system.  (Tr.  77,  88,  90,  213,  232-233)  In  February  2008,  Applicant \\ncontacted Company D’s FSO and advised her of the possibility of confidential data on \\nteam computers. The computers were collected to detect any spillage. (Tr. 205-206; GE \\n6 at 4) One of the SMEs also contacted his FSO about the possible spillage. (Tr. 206)   \\n\\n \\nApplicant  consulted  a  Navy  captain,  who  advised  Applicant  to  seek  the \\nassistance of counsel, and in February 2008, he hired a counsel with significant national \\nsecurity  experience.  (Tr.  203;  GE  5  at  2;  GE  6  at  4;  AE  M)  On  March  4,  2008, \\nApplicant’s  counsel  disclosed  to  the  FBI  that  Applicant  deleted  the  Company  D \\nproprietary files because Company L had requested the computers. (AE B at 2-3)  \\n\\n \\nAfter receipt of the first two computers, the Naval Criminal Investigative Service \\n(NCIS)  and  FBI  wanted  to  check  a  laptop  computer  and  a  desk  top  computer  in \\nApplicant’s  possession  for  spillage.  NCIS  requested  the  two  computers  in  February \\n2008. (Tr. 141; AE B) Applicant had saved tax returns and other personal information on \\nthe  desktop  computer.  The  desk  top  computer  was  obsolete  and  lacked  sufficient \\ncomputer  power  to  run  simulations,  and  Applicant  believed  it  had  no  risk  of  having \\nclassified data on it. (Tr. 210) Applicant’s attorney wanted to find out whether the two \\ncomputers were owned by Applicant, Company D, or DOD before providing them to the \\nFBI  or  NCIS.  (Tr.  141)  With  the  assistance  of  Company  D,  Applicant’s  attorney \\ndetermined  the  two  computers  were  probably  owned  by  DOD.  On  March  4,  2008, \\nApplicant’s  attorney  wrote  the  FBI  volunteering  to  have  Applicant  provide  the  two \\n\\n \\n5 \\n                                         \\n \\n\\n\f",
       "computers to the FBI. (Tr. 143-147, 164-165, 226; AE B; AE H) The FBI did not allege \\nthat  there  were  deletions  from  the  two  computers  Applicant  provided  in  March  2008; \\nhowever, Applicant said the Company D proprietary information that he did not want to \\nrelease to Company L was on the second set of computers provided to NCIS and the \\nFBI. (Tr. 228-230) Applicant deleted the Company D proprietary information. (Tr. 228-\\n232) Applicant’s attorney disclosed to the FBI that she had retained a copy of the hard \\ndrive of the desktop computer in her office safe. (Tr. 144; AE B) The FBI never asked \\nfor the copy of the hard drive. (Tr. 144-145) There is no evidence that the FBI found any \\nclassified information on the two computers provided on March 4, 2008. (Tr. 172)       \\n\\n \\nInvestigators checked some of the computers used in the project; however, they \\ndid  not  check  all  of the  other  computers  used  on the project  that  logically  might  also \\nhave spillage. (Tr. 79, 81, 88-89) C assumed that Company L was out to get Applicant \\nbecause  of  how  he  was  targeted  by  the  investigation.  (Tr.  82-83)  The  FBI  did  not \\ninterview C. (Tr. 80) \\n\\n \\nOn August 19, 2010, Applicant and his counsel met with an AUSA and others for \\na proffer session. (Tr. 149) Applicant advised the FBI that Applicant had compact discs \\nthat he  received from  Company  L  with  trusted  downloads for  testing  simulations.  (Tr. \\n156-159,  210,  212)  The  discs  were  marked  unclassified.  (Tr.  210)  Applicant  also \\ndisclosed  he  had  the  flash  drive  that  contained  the  C-file  that  he  downloaded  on  his \\ncomputer in December 2007. (Tr. 222) He had previously deleted the C-file off of the \\nflash drive. (Tr. 224) On August 23, 2010, Applicant provided the requested compact \\ndiscs and flash drive to the NCIS. (Tr. 159, 170, 222; AE H)  \\n\\n \\nAt  the  August  19,  2010  proffer,  AUSA,  an  FBI  special  agent,  and  two  NCIS \\nspecial agents asked Applicant numerous questions about the computers, project, and \\nclassified  data.  (Tr.  150;  AE  C)  The  forensic  examination  determined  that  classified \\nmaterials had been stored on one of the laptop computers. FBI SMEs, who were not \\nrelated to Applicant’s team, reviewed the “classified values” and concluded 11 values \\nwere not sufficiently scrambled to render them unclassified. (Tr. 213; GE 3; GE 5 at 3; \\nAE P) The classification level was deemed to be confidential. (AE L; AE P) Applicant \\nbelieved the FBI SMEs erred in the manner that some of the numbers were “reverse \\nengineered”  and  classified  as  confidential  or  secret.  (GE  6  at  5)  The  FBI  had  been \\nrelying  on  erroneous  information  from  SMEs,  and  the  FBI  SMEs  had  mistakenly \\nconfused some of the unclassified testing numbers with classified data. (Tr. 151, 154, \\n211; GE 3) Applicant agreed with the FBI that one table contained classified numbers. \\n(Tr.  151-154;  GE  5  at  2-3)  Applicant  conceded  his  unclassified  computer  should  not \\nhave  been  used  for  classified  information  because  it  did  not  contain  the  security \\nmeasures required for storage of classified material. (Tr. 155-156)  \\n\\n \\nThe AUSA appeared to accept that Applicant was involved in an inadvertent spill \\nof  classified  numbers  as  opposed  to  a  deliberate  attempt  to  compromise  classified \\ninformation. (Tr. 152) On December 16, 2010, an FBI special agent wrote the Defense \\nIndustrial  Security  Clearance  Office  (DISCO)  about  the  investigation  of  Applicant  for \\nunauthorized  removal  and  retention  of  classified  documents  or  material  in  possible \\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 1924. (GE 3) The FBI letter advised that no charges would be \\n\\n \\n6 \\n                                         \\n \\n\\n\f",

As  Commander  in  Chief,  the  President  has  the \\nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \\nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. \\nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \\napplicant’s  eligibility  for  access  to  classified  information  “only  upon  a  finding  that  it  is \\nclearly  consistent  with  the  national  interest  to  do  so.”  Exec.  Or.  10865,  Safeguarding \\nClassified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  \\n \\n\\nEligibility  for  a  security  clearance  is  predicated  upon  the  applicant  meeting  the \\ncriteria  contained  in  the  revised  adjudicative  guidelines.  These  guidelines  are  not \\ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \\nguidelines  are  applied  in  conjunction  with  an  evaluation  of  the  whole  person.  An \\nadministrative \\nimpartial,  and \\ncommonsense  decision.  An  administrative  judge  must  consider  all  available,  reliable \\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \\n\\njudge’s  overarching  adjudicative  goal \\n\\n  \\nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \\naccess  to  classified  information.  This  relationship  transcends  normal  duty  hours  and \\nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \\npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \\nabout  potential,  rather  than  actual,  risk  of  compromise  of  classified  information. \\nClearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \\n\\nis  a \\n\\nfair, \\n\\n \\n8 \\n                                         \\n \\n\\n\f",
       "a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. \\nThis decision is not based, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination \\nabout applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. Thus, any decision to deny a security \\nclearance  is  merely  an  indication  the  applicant  has  not  met  the  strict  guidelines  the \\nPresident and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  \\n\\n \\n \\nInitially,  the  Government  must  establish,  by  substantial  evidence,  conditions  in \\nthe  personal  or  professional  history  of  the  applicant  that  may  disqualify  the  applicant \\nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \\nof  establishing  controverted  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  See  Egan,  484  U.S.  at  531. \\n“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. \\nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \\npresume  a  nexus  or  rational  connection  between  proven  conduct  under  any  of  the \\ncriteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \\nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \\n \\n\\nOnce  the  Government  establishes  a  disqualifying  condition  by  substantial \\nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \\nfacts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \\nis  clearly  consistent  with  the  national  interest  to  grant  or  continue  his  security \\nclearance.”  ISCR  Case  No.  01-20700  at  3  (App.  Bd.  Dec.  19,  2002).  The  burden  of \\ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. \\n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \\nif they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).  \\n \\n\\nAnalysis \\n\\n \\nPersonal Conduct \\n \\n\\nAG ¶ 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \\n \\nConduct  involving  questionable  judgment,  lack  of  candor,  dishonesty,  or \\nunwillingness  to  comply  with  rules  and  regulations  can  raise  questions \\nabout  an  individual's  reliability,  trustworthiness  and  ability  to  protect \\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \\nand  candid  answers  during  the  security  clearance  process  or  any  other \\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \\n \\nTwo  personal  conduct  disqualifying  conditions  under  AG  ¶  16  are  potentially \\n\\napplicable. Those two disqualifying conditions provide:   \\n\\n \\n(d)  credible  adverse  information  that  is  not  explicitly  covered  under  any \\nother  guideline  and  may  not  be  sufficient  by  itself  for  an  adverse \\ndetermination,  but  which,  when  combined  with  all  available  information \\nsupports  a  whole-person  assessment  of  questionable \\njudgment, \\nuntrustworthiness,  unreliability,  lack  of  candor,  unwillingness  to  comply \\nwith  rules  and  regulations,  or  other  characteristics  indicating  that  the \\n\\n \\n9 \\n                                         \\n \\n\\n\f",

The  hard  drive  of  one  of  Applicant’s  computers  was  restricted  to \\nunclassified information use, and it was found to contain some classified data.

Applicant did not believe they contained classified information. On August \\n23, 2010, Applicant provided the compact discs and flash drive. There is no information \\nthat they contained classified information.   \\n\\n \\nSOR ¶ 1.e alleges Applicant had two computers that he provided to his attorney, \\nand his attorney retained them as of December 2010.

       "Further analysis concerning applicability of mitigating conditions is required. The \\nAppeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving the applicability \\nof mitigating conditions as follows:  \\n\\n \\nOnce  a  concern  arises  regarding  an  Applicant’s  security  clearance \\neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \\nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \\nCir.  1990),  cert.  denied,  499  U.S.  905  (1991).  After  the  Government \\npresents  evidence  raising  security  concerns,  the  burden  shifts  to  the \\napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The \\nstandard  applicable  in  security  clearance  decisions  is  that  articulated  in \\nEgan,  supra.  “Any  doubt  concerning  personnel  being  considered  for \\naccess  to  classified  information  will  be  resolved  in  favor  of  the  national \\nsecurity.” Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b).  \\n \\n\\nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  \\n\\n \\nThree mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 17 are potentially applicable:  \\n \\n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \\nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \\nunlikely  to  recur  and  does  not  cast  doubt  on  the  individual's  reliability, \\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \\n \\n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \\nto  change  the  behavior  or  taken  other  positive  steps  to  alleviate  the \\nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \\nor  other  inappropriate  behavior,  and  such  behavior  is  unlikely  to  recur;  \\nand \\n \\n(e)  the  individual  has  taken  positive  steps  to  reduce  or  eliminate \\nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \\n \\nAG ¶ 16(e) is mitigated by AG ¶ 17(e) because Applicant has fully disclosed his \\nrule violations. Law enforcement, security officials, and his witnesses are well aware of \\nhis  security-related  conduct,  and he  is not  vulnerable  to  exploitation, manipulation,  or \\nduress because of his security-related conduct. \\n\\n \\nAG ¶¶ 17(c) and 17(d) apply. The only evidence of Applicant’s December 2007 \\nsecurity breach was Applicant’s self-report; however, his self-report was not timely, as it \\nappears  it  was  disclosed  at  his  August  19,  2010  AUSA  proffer.  However,  Applicant’s \\nfailure to report the December 2007 security breach is not recent; the security breach \\nwas  inadvertent;  “it  happened  under  such  unique  circumstances  that  it  is  unlikely  to \\nrecur;”  and  it  “does  not  cast  doubt  on  Applicant’s  reliability,  trustworthiness,  or  good \\njudgment.”  He  admitted  that  he  showed  poor  judgment  in  December  2007  when  he \\ndiscovered that he had downloaded possible classified information onto B’s computer \\nand his own computer, and he failed to report this security breach to his FSO (SOR ¶ \\n\\n \\n11 \\n                                         \\n \\n\\n\f",
       "1.a).  Security  needed  to  assess  the  scope  of  the  breach  of  security  or  spillage,  and \\nsecurity was unable to check other computers and determine who was responsible for \\nthe “trusted download” that caused the security breach.  \\n\\n \\nApplicant  understands  the  importance  of  informing  security  of  any  security \\nbreach or possible security breach, and I am confident he will timely disclosed required \\ninformation. Personal conduct concerns are mitigated. Even if security concerns are not \\nmitigated under Guideline E, they are mitigated under the whole-person concept, infra. \\n \\nHandling Protected Information  \\n \\n  \\nAG  ¶  33  articulates  the  security  concern  relating  to  handling  protected \\ninformation  as  follows,  “Deliberate  or  negligent  failure  to  comply  with  rules  and \\nregulations for protecting classified or other sensitive information raises doubt about an \\nindividual’s trustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or willingness and ability to safeguard \\nsuch information, and is a serious security concern.” \\n\\n \\nAG  ¶  34  provides  three  disqualifying  conditions  that  could  raise  a  security \\n\\n  \\nconcern and may be disqualifying in this case:  \\n \\n\\n(b) collecting or storing classified or other protected information at home or \\nin any other unauthorized location; \\n \\n(c) loading, drafting, editing, modifying, storing, transmitting, or otherwise \\nhandling classified reports, data, or other information on any unapproved \\nequipment including but not limited to any typewriter, word processor, or \\ncomputer  hardware,  software,  drive,  system,  gameboard,  handheld, \\n\"palm\" or pocket device or other adjunct equipment; and \\n \\n(g) any failure to comply with rules for the protection of classified or other \\nsensitive information. \\n\\n \\n\\nAG ¶¶ 34(b), 34(c), and 34(g) apply. These three disqualifying conditions do not \\ninclude  a  requirement  that  Applicant  knew  he  was  downloading  classified  information \\nonto  an  unclassified  system,  and  they  do  not  require  that  he  be  aware  that  his \\nunclassified computer systems contain classified information.  \\n\\n \\nSOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.c discussed previously are cross-alleged under SOR ¶¶ 2.a \\nand  2.c.  In  December  2007,  Applicant  discovered  that  he  had  downloaded  possible \\nclassified  information  onto  B’s  computer  and  his  own  computer.  The  two  computers \\nwere not authorized for storage of classified information.   \\n\\n \\nThe hard drive of one of Applicant’s DOD-issued laptop computers was restricted \\nto unclassified information use, and a forensic evaluation and SME review found that his \\nlaptop computer contained some data classified at the confidential level. Applicant was \\nunaware  this  computer  contained  classified  information.  He  is  not  responsible  for \\n\\n \\n12 \\n                                         \\n \\n\\n\f",
       "“trusted  downloads,”  and  he  inadvertently  downloaded  classified  information  from  a \\ntrusted download onto his hard drive.  \\n\\n \\nThree mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 35 are potentially applicable:  \\n\\n \\n\\n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior, or it has happened so \\ninfrequently  or  under  such  unusual  circumstances,  that  it  is  unlikely  to \\nrecur  and  does  not  cast  doubt  on  the  individual's  current  reliability, \\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \\n \\n(b) the individual responded favorably to counseling or remedial security \\ntraining and now demonstrates a positive attitude toward the discharge of \\nsecurity responsibilities; and \\n \\n(c) the security violations were due to improper or inadequate training. \\n  \\nAG ¶¶ 35(a) through 35(c) apply. As indicated in the previous section, AG ¶ 35(a) \\nis  established.  The  particular  simulation  program  involving  inadvertent  transfers  of \\nclassified data to unclassified systems was changed to a completely classified system. \\nSuch  erroneous  “trusted  downloads”  will  not  recur.  Applicant  understands  how \\nimportant it is to avoid future transfers of classified information to unclassified computer \\nsystems.  He  has  been  counseled  and  understands  that  when  a  security  violation  is \\ndiscovered, it should be timely reported to his FSO. He has a positive attitude towards \\nconscientiously complying with security requirements.  \\n\\n \\nApplicant’s  actions  since  March  2008  show  sufficient  effort,  good  judgment, \\n  \\ntrustworthiness,  and  reliability  to  warrant  mitigation  of  handling  protected  information \\nsecurity  concerns.  Even  if  handling  protected  information  concerns  are  not  mitigated \\nunder Guideline K, they are mitigated under the whole-person concept, infra.    \\n\\n \\n\\nWhole-Person Concept \\n\\n \\n Under  the  whole-person  concept,  the  administrative  judge  must  evaluate  an \\nApplicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s \\nconduct  and all  the  circumstances.

       "Under  AG  ¶  2(c),  the  ultimate  determination  of  whether  to  grant  eligibility  for  a \\nsecurity  clearance  must  be  an  overall  commonsense  judgment  based  upon  careful \\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \\ncomments under Guidelines E and K in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors \\nin AG ¶ 2(a)  were addressed under Guidelines  E and K, but some warrant additional \\ncomment. \\n\\n  \\nApplicant is a 56-year-old software engineer employed by Company D from 1980 \\nto 2007. From 2008 to present, he has been employed by another defense contractor. \\nHis spouse is a security clearance holder; his father was a career Navy officer; his two \\nolder brothers served in the Navy; and his nephew was a Navy Seal, who served three \\ntours  in  Afghanistan.  In  1982,  Applicant  received  a  bachelor  of  science  degree  in \\nmathematics.  During  Desert  Shield,  Applicant  was  deployed  for  six  months  to  the \\nPersian Gulf aboard a U.S. Navy vessel.   \\n\\n \\nA Navy captain, who has known Applicant since the late 1990s; a high-level DOD \\nemployee, who has oversight authority over about 9,000 of DOD employees and a $300 \\nmillion budget and who has known Applicant since the 1990s; a program director on a \\nproject,  who  has  known  Applicant  since  2003;  two  contractors,  who  worked  with \\nApplicant  on  the  project  at  issue;  and  Applicant’s  attorney  described  Applicant  in \\nlaudatory  terms.  Applicant  is  an  “incredibly  gifted,”  exceptionally  creative,  and \\n“incredibly skilled” technician and engineer. He is diligent, intelligent, professional, open, \\ncandid, honest, and conscientious about the protection of classified information. Most of \\nhis  character  witnesses  were  aware  of  the  SOR  allegations,  had  read  Applicant’s \\nstatements in 2011 and 2013, and recommended reinstatement of Applicant’s security \\nclearance.  \\n\\n \\nApplicant’s  SOR  allegations  relate  to  his  handling  of  confidential  information  in \\nDecember  2007  and  January  2008  and  participation  in  the  follow-up  investigation  in \\n2009  and  2010.  Company  L  or  Navy  employees  provided  “trusted  downloads”  to \\nApplicant and his team. The trusted downloads were not supposed to contain classified \\ndata or software; however, there was some classified data mixed in with the unclassified \\ndata. Applicant and other members of his team unknowingly downloaded the classified \\nand  unclassified  information  onto  computers  allocated  to  unclassified  information. \\nApplicant  did  not  compromise  classified  information  as  there  is  no  evidence  the \\nunclassified  computers  were  used  by  anyone  not  authorized  to  review  the  classified \\ninformation. In December 2007, Applicant discovered possible classified information on \\nhis unclassified computer and on B’s computer. B and Applicant agreed that they should \\ndelete  it,  and  they  did  so.  This  error  was  aggravated  when  Applicant  and  B  failed  to \\ndisclose the discovery of the probable classified information on the flash drive and their \\ncomputers  to  their  FSOs.  Applicant  did  not  receive  adequate  training  or  supervision \\nfrom  B,  a  GS-13  Navy  employee  on  this  occasion.  There  was  no  evidence  that \\nApplicant was told prior to December 2007 of the protocol after discovery of possible \\nclassified information on an unclassified computer.  \\n\\n \\nAfter  two  of  Applicant’s  assigned  DOD-issued  computers  were  requested,  he \\ndeleted Company D proprietary information and personal information before providing \\n\\n \\n14 \\n                                         \\n \\n\\n\f",
       "one  computer  to  Company  D  and  one  computer to  NCIS. These deletions  raised  the \\npossibility  that  he  was  intentionally  obstructing  the  investigation  because  forensic \\nexamination revealed there were deletions, but could not determine the content of the \\ndeletions.  Applicant  provided  the  only  evidence  of  the  content  of  the  deletions.  In \\nFebruary  2008,  after  Applicant  made  the  deletions,  he  hired  an  experienced  national \\nsecurity attorney who advised him to cooperate with the investigation. After March 2008, \\nApplicant  cooperated  with  the  investigation,  and  his  attorney  notified  the  FBI  that  he \\nwould assist the investigation. His errors in judgment were made from December 2007 \\nthrough February 2008 and are not recent.   \\n\\n \\nApplicant’s hearing statement was credible. He understands what he needs to do \\nto maintain his eligibility for access to classified information. He has avoided any hint of \\nviolation  of  his  employer’s  rules  or  security  rules  after  March  2008.  He  expressed \\nsincere remorse for his infractions of security rules and errors in judgment in December \\n2007  and  January  2008,  and  he  emphasized  his  determination  to  conscientiously \\ncomply  with  all  security  rules  and  requirements.  I  am  confident  he  will  continue  to \\nconscientiously exercise his security responsibilities in the future. \\n\\n    \\nI  have  carefully  applied  the  law,  as  set  forth  in  Egan,  Exec.

Applicant  did  not  respond  to  the  FORM.  I  was \\nassigned the case on December 1, 2015. Based on a thorough review of the case file, I \\nfind that Applicant failed to carry his burden in mitigating security concerns arising under \\nboth Guideline B and Guideline E.  \\n\\n     Findings of Fact \\n\\n \\nApplicant  is  a  71-year-old  man  who  is  presently  not  working  while  his  security \\nclearance is updated. He has earned a high school diploma. He was divorced in 1998 \\n                                                           \\n1 The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \\nSecurity  Clearance  Review  Program  (January  2,  1992),  as  amended  (Directive);  and  the  adjudicative \\nguidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on September 1, 2006. \\n\\n1 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\f",
       "and is now estranged from a subsequent spouse. Facts about this estranged female are \\nunclear,  although  it  appears  she  is  from  Russia,  where  she  currently  resides  with  or \\nnear  family.  He  provided  incomplete  information  on  his  security  clearance  application \\n(SCA)  about  his  family  and  children.  Other  discrepancies  appear  throughout  his \\ninvestigatory record. Applicant presently lives in another country with a female foreign \\nnational  in  order  to  reduce  the  costs  he  would  otherwise  expend  living  in  the  United \\nStates while awaiting a return to work.  \\n \\n \\nAt issue in the SOR are the following facts: Applicant has a wife who is a citizen \\nand resident of Russia.2 They are estranged, but Applicant has no plans to divorce his \\nforeign  wife  because  he  no  longer  believes  in  divorce.  He  has  a  daughter  who  is  a \\ncitizen  of  the  United  States  and  is  currently  a  resident  of  Russia,  where  she  is  a \\nuniversity student. He also has parents-in-law who are citizens and residents of Russia. \\nApplicant met them in about July 1998 on a visit to their home. He again saw them on a \\nsubsequent  trip  to  Russia  with  his  wife.  He  has  had  no  other  contact  with  them  and \\ndoes not know how often his estranged wife currently has with her parents now that all \\nthree  are  in  Russia.  His  father-in-law  and  mother-in-law  are  a  teacher  and  a \\ngynecologist,  respectively.  Applicant  assumed  they  were  Communists  because  the \\nCommunists were in power when he met them. As of 2015, Russia is one of the two \\nleading state intelligence threats to United States interests, based on their capabilities, \\nintent,  and  broad  operational  scopes.3  Applicant  admits  the  Guideline  B  SOR \\nallegations, but did not address them in any manner in his SOR Response.     \\n \\n \\nIn completing SCAs in both August 3, 2009, and March 23, 2013, Applicant failed \\nto  list  multiple  names  he  has  used,  places  of  former  residence,  periods  of \\nunemployment, relatives, and foreign contacts. He told an investigator in 2010 that he \\nhad no problems while working with a particular employer, but later conceded he was \\ninvolved in a harassment suit while working there. Despite a 2010 claim to the contrary, \\nhe failed in 2007 to file an appropriate contact with foreign nationals report regarding the \\nforeign woman with whom he currently cohabitates. Applicant admits these allegations.  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\nPolicies \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nWhen  evaluating  an  applicant’s  suitability \\n\\n \\n \\nthe \\nadministrative  judge  must  consider  the  adjudicative  guidelines.  In  addition  to  brief \\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \\ndisqualifying  conditions  and  mitigating  conditions,  which  are  used  in  evaluating  an \\napplicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. \\n \\n\\nfor  a  security  clearance, \\n\\nThese  guidelines  are  not  inflexible  rules  of  law.  Instead,  recognizing  the \\ncomplexities  of  human  behavior,  these  guidelines  are  applied  in  conjunction  with  the \\n                                                           \\n2  In  some  records  within  the  FORM,  Applicant  indicated  that  his  estranged  wife  became  a  naturalized \\ncitizen in 2007 or 2008 and now resides in the United States, but the discrepancies are never resolved. \\n(See FORM, Item 6) \\n \\n3 FORM, Item 9, at 3. \\n\\n2 \\n\\n\f",
       "factors  listed  in  the  adjudicative  process.  The  administrative  judge’s  overarching \\nadjudicative  goal  is  a  fair,  impartial,  and  commonsense  decision.  According  to  AG  ¶ \\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \\nthe  “whole-person  concept.”  The  administrative  judge  must  consider  all  available, \\nreliable information about the person in making a decision. \\n\\n \\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) \\nrequires  that  “[a]ny  doubt  concerning  personnel  being  considered  for  access  to \\nclassified  information  will  be  resolved  in  favor  of  national  security.”  In  reaching  this \\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \\non the evidence contained in the record.  \\n\\n \\nUnder Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \\ncontroverted  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  Under  Directive  ¶  E3.1.15,  an  “applicant  is \\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \\nmitigate  facts  admitted  by  applicant  or  proven  by  Department  Counsel  and  has  the \\nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.”  \\n\\nthe  Government  predicated  upon \\n\\n \\nA  person  who  seeks  access  to  classified  information  enters  into  a  fiduciary \\nrelationship  with \\ntrust  and  confidence.  This \\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \\nGovernment  reposes  a  high  degree  of  trust  and  confidence  in  individuals  to  whom  it \\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \\nthe  possible  risk  the  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  safeguard \\nclassified information. Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall \\nbe “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \\nloyalty of the applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b).  \\n\\nThe security concern relating to the Guideline B is set out in AG ¶ 6: \\n\\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \\nany  foreign  interest.  Adjudication  under  this  Guideline  can  and  should \\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \\nfinancial \\nto,  such \\nconsiderations  as  whether  the  foreign  country  is  known  to  target  United \\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \\nrisk of terrorism. \\n\\nincluding,  but  not \\n\\nlocated, \\n\\ninterest \\n\\nlimited \\n\\nis \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n3 \\n\\nAnalysis \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\f",
       "Applicant remains married to the female of Russian origin at issue. Therefore, it \\ncan be assumed he maintains some level of affection for this woman, the mother of his \\nchild. It can also be assumed he maintains a bond or ties of affection for their child, who \\nis  now  studying  at  a  Russian  college.  As  for  his  in-laws,  while  their  contact  with \\nApplicant is negligible, it can be assumed his estranged partner has ties of affection with \\nher own parents. Those ties are routinely attributed to the spouse (Applicant) in these \\ncases. Given these facts, disqualifying conditions AG ¶¶ 7(a) and (b) apply:  \\n \\n\\nto  protect  sensitive \\n\\nAG ¶ 7(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \\nassociate,  friend,  or  other  person  who  is  a  citizen  of  or  resident  in  a \\nforeign  country  if  that  contact  creates  a  heightened  risk  of  foreign \\nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \\n \\nAG ¶ 7(b) connection to a foreign person, group, government, or country \\nthat  create  a  potential  conflict  of  interest  between  the  individual’s \\nobligation \\nthe \\nindividual’s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \\nthat information. \\n \\nIn  finding  disqualifying  conditions  applicable,  I  specifically  note  that  AG  ¶  7(a) \\nrequires substantial evidence of a heightened risk. The heightened risk required to raise \\na  disqualifying  condition  is  a  relatively  low  standard.  Heightened  risk  denotes  a  risk \\ngreater than the normal risk inherent in having a family member living under a foreign \\ngovernment or substantial assets in a foreign nation. Russia is one of the two leading \\nstate intelligence threats to United States interests. In addition, foreign family ties can \\npose a security risk even without a connection to a foreign government. This is because \\nan applicant may be subject to coercion or undue influence when a third party pressures \\nor  threatens  an  applicant’s family  members.  Under  these facts,  while  unlikely,  a  third \\nparty  coercion  concern  potentially  exists  in  Russia.  Therefore,  there  is  sufficient \\nevidence to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \\n\\ninformation  or \\n\\ntechnology  and \\n\\n  \\nAG ¶ 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \\n\\nof the mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 8, and find the following are relevant: \\n \\n\\nAG ¶ 8(a) the nature of the relationship with foreign persons, the country in \\nwhich  these  persons  are  located,  or  the  positions  or  activities  of  those \\npersons  in  that  country  are  such  that  it  is  unlikely  the  individual  will  be \\nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \\nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.; \\nand \\n\\n \\n\\nAG  ¶  8(b)  there  is  no  conflict  of  interest,  either  because  the  individual’s \\nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or \\ncountry  is  so  minimal,  or  the  individual  has  such  deep  and  longstanding \\nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to \\nresolve any conflict of interests in favor of the U.S. interests.  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n4 \\n\\n\f",
       "The mere possession of close family ties to persons in a foreign country is not, \\nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in \\na foreign country and an applicant has frequent, non-casual contacts with that relative, \\nthis  factor  alone  is  sufficient  to  create  the  potential  for  foreign  influence  and  could \\npotentially result in the compromise of classified information.  \\n\\n \\nHere,  Applicant  provided  scant  information about  his estranged  wife,  daughter, \\nand  in-laws.  Indeed,  information  about  his  in-laws  is  more  abundant  than  information \\nabout his child and her mother. While his personal ties to his in-laws may be weak, their \\nimpact on Applicant cannot be discerned without more information about his wife and \\nchild. Under these limited facts, no mitigating conditions weigh in Applicant’s favor. \\n\\nThe  security  concern  for  personal  conduct  is  set  out  in  AG  ¶  15,  where  the \\nsignificance of conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \\nunwillingness  to  comply  with  rules  and  regulations  is  defined  ([p]ersonal  conduct  can \\nraise  questions  about  an  individual’s  reliability,  trustworthiness  and  ability  to  protect \\nclassified  information).  Of  special  interest  is  any  failure to  provide  truthful and  candid \\nanswers during the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the \\nsecurity clearance process.  \\n\\n \\nIn completing his 2009 and 2013 SCAs, Applicant’s answers in many areas were \\neither deficient or in conflict. His answers in a 2010 interview were either intentionally or \\nnegligently incomplete  with regard to past  workplace problems and the reporting of a \\nforeign  cohabitant  to  his  former  employer.  If  these  inaccuracies  were  intentionally \\nincorrect, such facts could give rise to:  \\n\\n \\nAG  ¶  16(a)  deliberate  omission,  concealment,  or  falsification  of  relevant \\nfacts \\nfrom  any  personnel  security  questionnaire,  personal  history \\nstatement,  or  similar  form  used  to  conduct  investigations,  determine \\nemployment  qualifications,  award  benefits  or  status,  determine  security \\nclearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities, \\nand  \\n \\nAG  ¶  16(b)  deliberately  providing \\ninformation \\nconcerning  relevant  facts  to  an  employer,  investigator,  security  official, \\ncompetent medical authority, or other official government representative. \\n \\nApplicant admitted all three allegations raised under Guideline E and provided no \\nexplanations or commentary. While his admission to the SCA discrepancies could be \\ndiscounted and his discrepancies found to be the product of negligence, this guideline \\ncould  be  found  in  his  favor.  In  admitting  allegations  that  he  knowingly  withheld \\ninformation and denied having had problems while employed at a place where he was \\ninvolved in a harassment suit, however, the facts tend to indicate that these answers – \\nwithout  more  –  were  intentionally  false  or  misleading.  This  is  particularly  true  in  the \\n5 \\n\\nfalse  or  misleading \\n\\n \\n\\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n\f",
       "absence  of  some  explanation  claiming  forgetfulness  or  another  basis  for  having \\nprovided a negligently entered SCA answer. Therefore, given his admissions, none of \\nthe mitigating conditions at AG ¶ 17(a) – (g) apply.  \\n\\nWhole-Person Concept \\n \\n \\nUnder  the  whole-person  concept,  the  administrative  judge  must  evaluate  an \\napplicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s \\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a). Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) \\nwere addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment.  \\n \\n \\nApplicant failed to do more than admit the allegations raised in the SOR. He then \\nrequested a judgment based on the written record. It is that very record that is full of \\ndiscrepancies  and  contradictions  that  contributed  to  the  security  concerns  at  issue. \\nThere  are  simply  insufficient  facts  to  evaluate  Applicant’s  foreign  kin,  the  SCA  and \\ninterview inaccuracies, or even the Applicant as an individual. This is simply the result of \\na  deficiently  supplemented  record.

Contrast with, ISCR \\nCase No. 14-03112 (App. Bd.

Individual  applicants  are  eligible  for  access  to \\nclassified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent  with  the  national \\ninterest” to authorize such access. E.O. 10865 § 2. \\n\\n \\nWhen  evaluating  an  applicant’s  eligibility \\n\\nfor  a  security  clearance,  an \\nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \\nintroductory  explanations,  the  guidelines  list  potentially  disqualifying  and  mitigating \\nconditions.  The  guidelines  are  not  inflexible  rules  of  law.  Instead,  recognizing  the \\ncomplexities  of  human  behavior,  an  administrative  judge  applies  the  guidelines  in  a  \\ncommonsense manner, considering all available and reliable information, in arriving at a \\nfair and impartial decision.  \\n\\n \\nDepartment  Counsel  must  present  evidence  to  establish  controverted  facts \\nalleged  in  the  SOR.

ISCR Case \\nNo. 12-01266 at 3 (App. Bd.

       "“security  clearance  determinations  should  err,  if  they  must,  on  the  side  of  denials.” \\nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \\n\\nthe  Government  predicated  upon \\n\\n \\nA  person  who  seeks  access  to  classified  information  enters  into  a  fiduciary \\n \\nrelationship  with \\ntrust  and  confidence.  This \\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of \\ntrust  and  confidence  in  individuals  to  whom  it  grants  access  to  classified  information. \\nDecisions  include,  by  necessity,  consideration  of  the  possible  risk  an  applicant  may \\ndeliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  safeguard  classified  information.  Such  decisions \\nentail  a  certain  degree  of  legally  permissible  extrapolation  of  potential,  rather  than \\nactual, risk of compromise of classified information. \\n \\n\\nClearance  decisions  must  be  made  “in  terms  of  the  national  interest  and  shall \\nin  no  sense  be  a  determination  as  to  the  loyalty  of  the  applicant  concerned.”  E.O. \\n10865 § 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance amounts to a finding that an \\napplicant,  at  the  time  the  decision  was  rendered,  did  not  meet  the  strict  guidelines \\nestablished for determining eligibility for access to classified information. \\n\\n \\n\\nAnalysis \\n\\n \\n\\nGuideline C, Foreign Preference  \\n \\n \\nUnder  AG  ¶  9,  the  foreign  preference  security  concern  arises  “[w]hen  an \\nindividual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the \\nUnited States.” Applicant actively exercised his foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. \\ncitizen,  including  voting  in  Russian  elections  and  renewing,  using,  and  maintaining  a \\nRussian passport. This record evidence raises the foreign preference security concern \\nand  establishes  the  disqualifying  condition  at  AG  ¶  10(a).10  The  foreign  preference \\nguideline also sets forth a number of potential mitigation conditions. I have considered \\nall the mitigating conditions and none apply. Notably, Applicant currently has a foreign \\npassport and is unwilling to relinquish or surrender it. A current or prospective clearance \\nholder  is  ineligible  for  a  security  clearance  unless  s/he  surrenders  it  to  the  cognizant \\nsecurity authority (CSA), invalidates the foreign passport, or receives approval from the \\nCSA for his/her continued possession and use of the foreign passport. See AG ¶¶ 11(d) \\nand  11(e).  Applicant  did  not  supply  any  information  that  any  of  the  preceding \\ncircumstances apply. Accordingly, foreign preference security concerns remain.  \\n \\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \\n \\n\\nThe foreign influence security concern is explained at AG ¶ 6:  \\n \\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \\n\\n                                                           \\n10 Exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen . . .

Furthermore,  an  applicant  is  not  required  “to  sever  all  ties  with  a  foreign \\ncountry before he or she can be granted access to classified information.”13 However, \\nwhat  factor  or  combination  of  factors  will  mitigate  security  concerns  raised  by  an \\napplicant  with  family  members  in  a  foreign  country  is  not  easily  identifiable  or \\nquantifiable.14  An  administrative  judge’s  predictive  judgment  in  these  types  of  cases \\nmust be guided by a commonsense assessment of the evidence and consideration of \\nthe adjudicative guidelines, as well as the whole-person factors set forth in the Directive. \\nA judge’s ultimate determination must also take into account the overarching standard \\nin  all  security  clearance  cases,  namely,  that  any  doubt  raised  by  an  applicant’s \\ncircumstances must be resolved in favor of national security. AG ¶ 2(b). \\n \\n \\nI  have  considered  all  the foreign  influence mitigating  conditions and,  based  on \\nthe  record  evidence,  none  apply.  Even  if  I  assume  for  the  sake  of  argument  that \\nApplicant’s property and non-familial connections in Russia are not significant enough to \\ncause  a  conflict  of  interest  with  his  security  obligations,  his  and  his  wife’s  close \\nrelationship to their family members in Russia raise a concern about his vulnerability or \\nsusceptibility to adverse foreign influence. Applicant’s relatives in Russia are subject to \\nthe dictates of a government whose respect for human rights and the rule of law is, at \\nbest, questionable.  Moreover, Russia has been identified by the U.S. Government as \\ncontinuing  to  pose  an  intelligence  threat.  Applicant’s  familial  connections  in  Russia, \\ncoupled with the threat posed by the current Russian government to its own people and \\nthe security threat it poses to the United States, raises a heightened risk that Applicant \\ncould  be  subjected  to  adverse  foreign  influence.  Applicant  did  not  present  sufficient \\ninformation  to  mitigate  this  security  concern.  However,  this  adverse  finding  is  “not  a \\ncomment on Applicant’s patriotism but merely an acknowledgment that people may act \\nin unpredictable ways when faced with choices that could be important to a loved-one, \\nsuch as a family member.” ISCR Case No. 08-10025 at 4 (App. Bd.

An administrative judge should consider the \\nnine factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a).15 I hereby incorporate my comments under Guidelines \\nB and C. I gave due consideration to all the favorable and extenuating factors in this \\ncase, including Applicant’s honesty about his foreign connections from the start of the \\nsecurity  clearance  process.  Furthermore,  I  recognize  that  Applicant  left  Russia  nearly \\n                                                           \\n13 ISCR Case No. 07-13739 at 4 (App. Bd.

       "The Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On\\nOctober 17, 2014, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\\ndecision–security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of\\nDefense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). Applicant  requested a hearing.\\nOn  November  21,  2015,  after  the  hearing,  Defense  Office  of  Hearings  and  Appeals  (DOHA)\\nAdministrative  Judge  Francisco  Mendez  denied  Applicant’s  request  for  a  security  clearance.\\nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive ¶¶ E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\\n\\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge’s adverse decision was\\n\\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\\n\\nThe Judge’s Findings of Fact\\n\\nThe Judge made the following findings pertinent to the issues raised on appeal.  Applicant\\nhas been continuously employed since 2004 and has held a clearance since 2008.  He owes the IRS\\nabout  $40,000  for  unpaid  taxes  from  tax  years  2005  through  2012  and  for  2014.1    Applicant\\nattributed his tax problems to his having spent funds on a wedding rather than his taxes, as well as\\nto inadequate withholding.  Over the past several years Applicant has entered into a number of\\ninstallment agreements with the IRS.  When he is unable to pay, he contacts the IRS and negotiates\\na new agreement.  Applicant has resolved other debts alleged in the SOR.  He has about $700 in\\ndiscretionary income each month.  His budget does not show any payments to the IRS.\\n\\nThe Judge’s Analysis\\n\\nThe Judge cleared Applicant of all SOR debts except those pertaining to his delinquent taxes.\\nHe noted that Applicant has been fully employed for many years but has consistently failed to pay\\nhis taxes in full.  The Judge noted that Applicant did not pay his 2014 taxes, which would have\\nbecome due after the receipt of the SOR.  The Judge concluded that not even the possible loss of a\\nsecurity clearance could motivate Applicant to change his financial habits.\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\nApplicant cites to evidence that he has resolved other SOR debts.  He also points to his latest\\nrepayment plan that, he argues, will enable him to resolve his tax delinquencies.  Applicant’s\\nargument is not sufficient to rebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the evidence in\\nthe record.  Neither is it sufficient to show that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was\\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-06093 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 4,\\n2015).  \\n\\n1The SOR alleged tax debts up through tax year 2011.  The Judge stated that he was considering the non-alleged\\n\\ndebts only in evaluating Applicant’s case for mitigation and the whole-person factors.  Decision at 3, note 7.  \\n\\n2\\n\\n\f",

Applicant notes\\nthat the attorney who represented him at the hearing had requested the Judge not to consider several\\npages of the transcript due to a malfunction with the video-teleconference equipment.  The Judge\\nstated that he did not consider these pages.  Decision at 2, note 6.  Therefore, any technical problem\\nthat may have occurred did not impair Applicant’s receipt of due process.  \\n\\nThe Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the\\ndecision.

Department Counsel indicated the Government \\nwas prepared to proceed on August 3, 2015. The case was assigned to me on October \\n5, 2015. A Notice of Hearing was issued on October 28, 2015. I convened the hearing \\nas scheduled on November 17, 2015. \\n \\n \\nDuring the hearing, three Government exhibits (GE) 1 through 3, and eight of the \\nnine Applicant exhibits (AE) A, B, and D through I, were admitted into evidence without \\nobjection.  AE  C  was  admitted  over  the  objection,  based  on  hearsay,  of  Department \\nCounsel.  Applicant  and  one  witness  testified.  The  transcript  (TR.)  was  received  on \\nNovember  25,  2015.  I  kept  the  record  open  to  enable  Applicant  to  supplement  it. \\nApplicant  took  advantage  of  that  opportunity.  He  timely  submitted  a  number  of \\ndocuments  which  were  marked  as  AE  J  and  K,  and  admitted  into  evidence  without \\nobjection.

       "Applicant  received  a  bachelor  of  arts  degree  in  Computer  Science  in  May  1981.7 \\nApplicant  was  married  in  August  1984,  separated  in  December  2009,  and  divorced  in \\nJuly  2010.  He  married  his  current  wife  in  October  2014.8  He  adopted  his  first  wife’s \\ndaughter (born in 1976) in the mid-1980’s.9 \\n\\nApplicant and his first wife started drifting apart and went through several years \\nfilled with marital issues leading up to their separation and actual divorce. She refused \\nto  attend  Applicant’s  father’s  funeral  in  1995,  his  mother’s  funeral  in  1999,  his  college \\nreunion, or his niece’s wedding in 2008. He claimed  it got to the point where he asked \\nher  to  help  him  with  something  and  she  refused.  He  experienced  a  difficult  residence \\nreconstruction  project.  There  was  a  lack  of  communication  between  Applicant  and  his \\nwife.  After  the  separation,  attempted  reconciliations  failed.  During  the  period  of  his \\nseparation,  an  employer’s  contract  ended  and  his  position  was  vacated.  He  searched \\nfor  a  new  position,  and  actually  obtained  several  short-term  ones.  During  the  period \\n2004 until 2013, 18 friends or relatives passed away. Applicant incurred several injuries, \\nillnesses,  and  conditions,  and  he  went  through  several  surgeries.  At  least  one  very \\nclose friend noticed the emotional stress that the various issues were causing Applicant. \\nTo  minimize  the  stress  which  really  started  to  affect  him  in  about  2006,  and  to  relax, \\nApplicant \\nturned  to  playing  Internet  games  and  chatting  during  online  dating \\nrelationships.10 \\n\\n \\n\\nUse of Information Technology Systems &amp; Personal Conduct \\n  \\n\\n(SOR  ¶¶  1.a.  and  3.a.):  Applicant  was  employed  by  a  particular  government \\ncontractor  from  May  2010  until  July  2010.  On  or  about  July  24,  2010,  Applicant  was \\nlooking through his personal e-mails on his government furnished equipment (GFE), a \\ncomputer,  and  accessed  some  online  dating  sites,  sports  sites,  and  book  sites. When \\nhe  opened  some  unsolicited  e-mails,  he  found  that  they  contained  photos  of  nude \\nwomen.  One  e-mail  contained  one  photo  of  five  nude  women  and  another  e-mail  had \\none  photo  which  he  considered  offensive,  but  did  not  describe.  He  claimed  that  if  he \\nhad  known  the  e-mails  contained  photos  of  nude  women,  he  would  not  have  opened \\nthem  on  his  office  GFE.  He  immediately  deleted  the  e-mails  after  conferring  with  a \\ncolleague.  Applicant  denied  that  he  ever  intentionally  used  his  GFE  to  look  at \\npornographic photos. This was the only time any of the e-mails he opened on his GFE \\ncontained photos of nude women. In addition, Applicant’s GFE computer screen saver \\nand  wall  paper  contained  approximately  eight  photos  of  his  scantly  clothed  girlfriend \\nwhich were not pornographic.11  \\n                                                           \\n \\n\\n7 GE 1, supra note 1, at 13; AE H (Diploma, dated May 23, 1981); AE F, supra note 4, at 1. \\n \\n8 GE 1, supra note 1, at 28-29; Tr. at 46 \\n \\n9 Tr. at 47-48. \\n \\n10 AE B (Biography, dated February 15, 2015), at 2-3; Applicant’s Answer to the SOR, supra note 3, at 3-5, \\n\\n8; Tr. at 29-33, 46-48, 53-54. \\n\\n \\n11 GE 3 (Personal Subject Interview, dated November 18, 2010), at 1-2; GE 3 (Personal Subject Interview, \\n\\ndated December 6, 2010), at 1; Tr. at 50-51, 54; Applicant’s Answer to the SOR, supra note 3, at 1-2. \\n\\n \\n3 \\n                                      \\n \\n\\n\f",
       "On  or  about  July  27,  2010,  one  of  Applicant’s  supervisors  approached  him  and \\nasked  to  see  the  photos  of  his  residence  reconstruction  project.  Applicant’s  GFE \\ncomputer wallpaper included photographs of his then-girlfriend in a bikini. After viewing \\nher photos and photos of the residence, the supervisor departed. What occurred next is \\nunclear.  Applicant  was  initially  of  the  belief  that  she  went  directly  to  the  information \\ntechnology  (IT)  department  and  asked  that  Applicant’s  GFE  computer  be  scanned. \\nThere is also some evidence that Applicant’s  GFE was merely randomly scanned. The \\nactual fact in this regard in unimportant. According to an incident report filed on July 30, \\n2010, the scan of Applicant’s GFE found that he had been accessing websites for online \\ndating which were characterized as “inappropriate,” as well as 15 photos that were also \\ncharacterized as “inappropriate.” Two of the photos were deemed “sexually explicit” and \\n“pornographic” in nature.12  \\n\\n \\nOn  July  28,  2010,  Applicant  was  terminated  from  his  employment  without \\nwarning due to “violation of company policy” and “unauthorized use of GFE for sexually \\nexplicit  or  sexually  oriented materials.”13  Although  the  SOR  alleged  that Applicant  was \\nterminated  from  employment  for  “viewing  pornographic  websites,”  the  evidence  upon \\nwhich  the  allegations  are  based,  the  Incident  History,  simply  refers  to  them  as \\n“inappropriate websites.”14 The two terms are not synonymous. \\n\\n \\nThere  is  no  IT  report  of  specific  findings,  a  report  of  investigation  by  the \\nemployer, a copy of the company policy supposedly violated by Applicant, copies of the \\ntroublesome  photographs,  or  explicit  descriptions  of  what  were  construed  as  sexually \\nexplicit  of  pornographic,  in  evidence.  There  is  no  evidence  of  any  subsequent  alleged \\nmisuse of GFE or violations of company policies.15 \\n\\n \\n\\nForeign Influence \\n \\n \\nOver  a  period  estimated  by  Applicant  to  be  15  months,  Applicant  chatted  with \\nvarious  foreign  individuals  while  playing  online  games  and  involved  in  online  dating.  He \\nexplained  that  to  be  successful  in  these  games,  it  was  necessary  to  “ally”  with  as  many \\nindividuals  as  possible  to  assist  him  in  winning.  The  games  required  communication  and \\noccasional  chats.  Applicant’s  online  dating  resulted  in  “relationships”  with  several  foreign \\nwomen, but none of those “relationships” involved physically seeing or meeting the women \\nexcept by telephone, or photographs and videos.  \\n \\n\\nOne such “relationship” with a woman in the Philippines in November 2009 involved \\nhis sending various sums of money to her via Western Union. Applicant’s two explanations \\nregarding  the  amounts  sent  her  are  inconsistent.  He  told  an  investigator  from  the  U.S. \\nOffice  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM)  in  October  2010  that  he  had  sent  her  $6,000  for \\nplane reservations, $7,000 for her father’s medical care, and $25 for support.  He changed \\n                                                                                                                                                                                           \\n\\n \\n12 Tr. at 82-83; GE 3 (Personal Subject Interview (November 18, 2010)), supra note 11, at 1. \\n \\n13 GE 2 (Incident Report, dated August 6, 2013). \\n \\n14 GE 2, supra note 13. \\n \\n15 Tr. at 56. \\n\\n \\n4 \\n                                      \\n \\n\\n\f",

He  changed  the  amounts  during  the  hearing,  and  said \\nhe sent her $2,000 for plane reservations. He added that he also sent her unspecified sums \\non  over  ten  occasions.

He changed the amounts during the hearing, and said he sent her $370 to \\nbuy  out  her  contract.

He sent her an unspecified sum of money to travel to the United States, but \\nshe used it for other purposes. When she requested additional money, he refused to send it \\nand the “relationship” ended.19 \\n\\n \\nApplicant  met  other  foreign  women  over  the  Internet,  but  none  of  those  involved \\nsending  money  to  them,  even  though  some  of  the  women  requested  money.  He \\nacknowledged that some of the women were taking advantage of him in scams, but he was \\nnot aware of the truth until later. He denied having a bond of affection, loyalty, or friendship \\nobligation  for  any  of  the  foreign  nationals  with  whom  he  had  the  aforementioned \\n“relationships.” Applicant entered into an exclusive relationship with the woman who is now \\nhis  wife  in  May  2011.

Once the Government has produced \\nsubstantial  evidence  of  a  disqualifying  condition,  under  Directive  ¶  E3.1.15,  the \\napplicant  has  the  burden  of  persuasion  to  present  evidence  in  refutation,  explanation, \\nextenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s \\ncase. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.36  \\n\\nthe  Government  predicated  upon \\n\\n \\nA  person  who  seeks  access  to  classified  information  enters  into  a  fiduciary \\ntrust  and  confidence.  This \\nrelationship  with \\nrelationship  transcends  normal  duty  hours  and  endures  throughout  off-duty  hours  as \\nwell.  It  is  because  of  this  special  relationship  that  the  Government  must  be  able  to \\nrepose  a  high  degree  of  trust  and  confidence  in  those  individuals  to  whom  it  grants \\naccess  to  classified  information.  Decisions  include,  by  necessity,  consideration  of  the \\npossible  risk  the applicant may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to safeguard  classified \\ninformation. Such decisions  entail  a  certain degree  of  legally  permissible  extrapolation \\nas  to  potential,  rather  than  actual,  risk  of  compromise  of  classified  information.  \\nFurthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of \\ndenials.”37 \\n\\n \\nClearance  decisions  must  be  “in  terms  of  the  national  interest  and  shall  in  no \\nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”38 Thus, nothing \\nin this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole \\nor in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, \\nor  patriotism.

Information  Technology  Systems  include  all  related \\ncomputer  hardware,  software, \\nthe \\ncommunication, \\ntransmission,  processing,  manipulation,  storage,  or \\nprotection of information. \\n\\nfirmware,  and  data  used \\n\\nfor \\n\\nThe  guideline notes  a  condition  that  could  raise  security  concerns.  Under  AG ¶ \\n40(e),  security  concerns  may  be  raised  by  the  “unauthorized  use  of  a  government  or \\nother  information  technology  system.”  This  guideline  generally  refers  to  sending  or \\nsoliciting sexually-oriented messages or images, or the downloading, creating, storing, \\nor  displaying  computer  files  of  a  sexual  nature.  In  mid-2010,  Applicant  opened  an \\nInternet  site  on  his  GFE  that  his  employer  considered  an  “inappropriate”  website.  The \\nsole  evidence  pertaining  to  it  was  the  name,  and  that  name,  without  more,  seems  to \\nindicate  it  was  an  online  dating  website.  There  is  zero  evidence  that  it  was  a \\n“pornographic”  website.  In  July  2010,  while  he  was  again  on  the  GFE,  he opened  two \\nunsolicited  e-mails  addressed  to  him.  One  of  the  e-mails  contained  photos  of  nude \\nwomen  and  the  other  contained  a  photo  of  what  he  considered  offensive.  Applicant \\npromptly  deleted  the  e-mails.  He  also  had  photos  of  his  scantily  clad  girlfriend  on  his \\nscreen saver and wall paper. A subsequent computer scan of his GFE conducted by the \\nIT department revealed the access to the “inappropriate” website as well as the photos \\nthat  were  characterized  as  “inappropriate.”  Two  of  the  photos  were  deemed  “explicit” \\nand  “pornographic”  in  nature.  As  a  result,  the  following  day,  Applicant  was  terminated \\nfrom his employment due to “violation of company policy” and “unauthorized use of GFE \\nfor sexually explicit or sexually oriented materials.” AG ¶ 40(e) has been established. \\n \\n \\nThe  guideline  also  includes  examples  of  conditions  that  could  mitigate  such \\nsecurity  concerns.  Under  AG  ¶  41(a),  the  disqualifying  condition  may  be  mitigated \\nwhere  “so much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it happened under \\nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \\nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.” Similarly, AG ¶ 41(c) applies \\nwhere  “the  conduct  was  unintentional  or  inadvertent  and  was  followed  by  a  prompt, \\ngood-faith effort to correct the situation and by notification of supervisor.”  \\n \\n \\nWhile  Applicant  did  not  promptly  notify  his  supervisor,  he  did  confer  with  a \\ncolleague to determine what to do, and he immediately deleted the e-mails in an effort \\nto correct the situation. According to the apparent prevailing community standards, the \\nemployer  considered  two  of  the  photos  to  be  “sexually  explicit”  and  “pornographic”  in \\n\\n \\n9 \\n                                      \\n \\n\\n\f",
       "nature.  Department  Counsel  argued  that  this  was  not  the  only  such  incident  and  that \\nApplicant  “had  a  history  of  viewing  this  material.”39  His  argument  is  based  purely  on \\nspeculation,  for  there  is  no  evidence  to  suggest  that  it  happened  more  than  once. \\nNevertheless,  even  assuming  the  accuracy  of  the  allegation,  the  passing  of  over  four \\nand  one-half  years  from  the  incident  to  the  date  the  SOR  was  issued,  without \\nrecurrence,  is  sufficient  to  conclude  that  it  is  unlikely  to  recur,  and  it  no  longer  casts \\ndoubt  on  Applicant’s  reliability,  trustworthiness,  and  good  judgment.    AG  ¶  41(a) \\napplies, and AG ¶ 41(c) partially applies. \\n \\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \\n \\n\\nThe security concern for Personal Conduct is set out in AG &amp; 15:       \\n\\n \\n\\nConduct  involving  questionable  judgment,  lack  of  candor,  dishonesty,  or \\nunwillingness  to  comply  with  rules  and  regulations  can  raise  questions \\nabout  an  individual's  reliability,  trustworthiness  and  ability  to  protect \\nclassified  information.  Of  special  interest  is  any  failure  to  provide  truthful \\nand  candid  answers  during  the  security  clearance  process  or  any  other \\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \\n \\nThe  guideline  notes  conditions  that  could  raise  security  concerns.  Under  AG  ¶ \\n\\n16(c), security concerns may be raised by:  \\n\\ncredible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is not \\nsufficient  for  an  adverse  determination  under  any  other  single  guideline, \\nbut  which,  when  considered  as  a  whole,  supports  a  whole-person \\nassessment  of  questionable  judgment,  untrustworthiness,  unreliability, \\nlack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \\ncharacteristics  indicating  that  the  person  may  not  properly  safeguard \\nprotected information. \\n\\nAlso, it is potentially disqualifying under AG ¶ 16(e) when there is: \\n\\npersonal conduct, or concealment of information about one’s conduct, that \\ncreates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1) \\nengaging  in  activities  which,  if  known,  may  affect  the  person’s  personal, \\nprofessional, or community standing. . . .  \\n\\nThe  alleged  behavior  consisted  of  being  involuntarily  terminated  from  his \\nemployment  in  July  2010  for  “viewing  pornographic  websites.”  Applicant  has  been \\nconsistent  in  his  rendition  of  the  facts.  The  evidence  is  not  in  dispute.  Applicant  was \\ninvoluntarily  terminated  from  his  employment  due  to  “violation  of  company  policy”  and \\n“unauthorized  use  of  GFE  for  sexually  explicit  or  sexually  oriented  materials.”  The  IT \\nscan  of  Applicant’s  GFE  revealed  that  he  viewed  an  “inappropriate”  online  dating \\nwebsite, but there is zero evidence that the website was “pornographic” in nature.

       "allegation  failed  to  address  the  issues  related  to  the  e-mails.  Nevertheless,  there  is \\nreason for further discussion. AG ¶¶ 16(c) and 16(e) have been partially established.  \\n\\n \\nThe  guideline  also  includes  examples  of  conditions  that  could  mitigate  security \\nconcerns  arising  from  personal  conduct.  AG  ¶  17(c)  may  apply  if  “the  offense  is  so \\nminor,  or  so  much  time  has  passed,  or  the  behavior  is  so  infrequent,  or  it  happened \\nunder such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on \\nthe individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.”  \\n\\n \\nSimilarly, AG ¶ 17(d) may apply if “the individual has acknowledged the behavior \\nand  obtained  counseling  to  change  the  behavior  or  taken  other  positive  steps  to \\nalleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \\nor  other  inappropriate  behavior,  and  such  behavior  is  unlikely  to  recur.”  Also,  if  “the \\nindividual  has  taken  positive  steps  to  reduce  or  eliminate  vulnerability  to  exploitation, \\nmanipulation, or duress,” AG ¶ 17(e) may apply. \\n\\n  \\nIn  July  2010,  during  a  period  when  Applicant  was  under  substantial  emotional \\nstress,  he  was  involuntarily  terminated  from  his  employment  due  to  “violation  of \\ncompany policy” and “unauthorized use of GFE for sexually explicit or sexually oriented \\nmaterials.” The alleged behavior, both the viewing of an “inappropriate website as well \\nas  the  opening  of  unsolicited  e-mails  each  occurred  on  one  occasion,  over  four  and \\none-half years before the SOR was issued. Applicant took positive efforts to reduce or \\neliminate  the  behavior  of  online  dating  and  game-playing.  He  remarried.  He  was \\nsubsequently  evaluated  by  a  licensed  psychologist  and  found  to  be  free  of  any \\npsychological  disorders.  He  acknowledged  his  behavior.  There  is  no  evidence  of  any \\nsubsequent  alleged  personal  conduct.  Considering  the  fact  that  the  “inappropriate” \\nwebsite dealt with online dating, and not pornography, the significance of the personal \\nconduct  is  minimized.  Applicant  has  reduced  or  eliminated  his  vulnerability  to \\nexploitation, and through his rehabilitative efforts, the  alleged untrustworthy, unreliable, \\nor other inappropriate behavior, is unlikely to recur. AG ¶¶ 17(c), 17(d), and 17(e) apply. \\n \\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \\n \\n\\nThe security concern under the Foreign Influence guideline is set out in AG ¶ 6:       \\n\\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \\nany  foreign  interest.  Adjudication  under  this  Guideline  can  and  should \\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \\nfinancial \\nto,  such \\nconsiderations  as  whether  the  foreign  country  is  known  to  target  United \\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \\nrisk of terrorism. \\n\\nincluding,  but  not \\n\\ninterest \\n\\nis \\n\\nlocated, \\n\\nlimited \\n\\n \\n\\n11 \\n\\n                                      \\n \\n\\n\f",
       "The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \\nAG  ¶  7(a),  it  is  potentially  disqualifying  where  there  is  “contact  with  a  foreign  family \\nmember, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of \\nor  resident  in  a  foreign  country  if  that  contact  creates  a  heightened  risk  of  foreign \\nexploitation,  inducement,  manipulation,  pressure,  or  coercion.”  Similarly,  under  AG  ¶ \\n7(e), security concerns may be raised when there is  “a substantial business, financial, \\nor  property  interest  in  a  foreign  country,  or  in  any  foreign-owned  or  foreign-operated \\nbusiness,  which  could  subject  the  individual  to  heightened  risk  of  foreign  influence  or \\nexploitation.  \\n\\nApplicant  is  not  a  naturalized  U.S.  citizen.  He  was  born  in  the  United  States  of \\nparents  who  were  also  born  in  the  United  States.  His  entire  immediate  and  extended \\nfamily members are also U.S. citizens. There is no evidence (or allegations) that he has \\nany  family  members  or  business  or  professional  associates  who  are  citizens  or \\nresidents of a foreign  country. In 2009 and 2010, he did, however, have long-distance \\nonline and telephone relationships with several women who were foreign-born residents \\nof  various  countries.  Although  he  never  physically  saw  or  met  the  women,  except  by \\ntelephone, photographs, or videos, he did send them various sums of money, estimated \\nto  be  a  total  in  excess  of  $60,000,  allegedly  earmarked  by  the  recipients  for \\ntransportation,  medical  care,  support,  and  release \\nfrom  a  customs.  Applicant \\nacknowledged that some of the women were taking advantage of him in scams, but he \\nwas not aware of the truth until later. He denied having a bond of affection, loyalty, or \\nfriendship  obligation  for  any  of  the  foreign  nationals  with  whom  he  had  the \\naforementioned “relationships.”   \\n\\nApplicant’s online dating and gaming forays with foreign women ceased in 2011 \\nwhen  he  met  the  woman  who  eventually  became  his  second  wife.  The  security \\nsignificance  of  these  identified  conditions  requires  further  examination  of  Applicant’s \\nformer  foreign  “relationships”  to  determine  the  degree  of  “heightened  risk”  or  potential \\nconflict  of  interest.  Furthermore,  Department  Counsel  argued  that  Applicant’s  actions \\nrevealed  cloudy  judgment,  a  lack  of  self-discipline,  and  a  vulnerability    to  possible \\nmanipulation and exploitation.  The SOR alleged that Applicant wired money to various \\noversea  locations  “in  an  attempt  to  incite  the  relationships.”  (Emphasis  added).40  The \\nevidence  is  persuasive  that,  after  nearly  three  decades  of  marriage  and  a  separation \\nand pending divorce, Applicant was active in online dating and simply wished to make \\nthe right social connection with a female. Nevertheless, AG ¶¶ 7(a) and 7(e) are partially \\nestablished. \\n\\nThe  guideline  also  includes  examples  of  conditions  that  could  mitigate  security \\nconcerns  arising  from  foreign  influence.  Under  AG  ¶  8(a),  the  disqualifying  condition \\nmay be mitigated where: \\n\\n                                                           \\n\\n40  It  is  unclear  why  the  word  “incite”  was  used  in  the  SOR  for  that  word  generally  conveys  a  negative \\nimplication, such as to stir up, fan the flames of, provoke, inflame, egg on, whip up, or foment. The evidence seems to \\ninfer another meaning such as encourage, kindle, arouse, or stimulate.  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n12 \\n\\n                                      \\n \\n\\n\f",
       "the  nature  of  the  relationships  with  foreign  persons,  the  country  in  which \\nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \\nthat  country  are  such  that  it  is  unlikely  the  individual  will  be  placed  in  a \\nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \\ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.  \\n\\nSimilarly, AG ¶ 8(b) may apply where the evidence shows:  \\n\\nthere  is  no  conflict  of  interest,  either  because  the  individual's  sense  of \\nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \\nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \\nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \\nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest. \\n\\nIn  addition,  AG  ¶  8(c)  may  apply  where  “contact  or  communication  with  foreign \\ncitizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk \\nfor foreign influence or exploitation.”  \\n\\nIn  assessing  whether  there  is  a  heightened  risk  because  of  an  applicant’s \\n“relationships”  in  foreign  countries,  it  is  necessary  to  consider  all  relevant  factors, \\nincluding the totality of an applicant’s conduct and circumstances in light of any realistic \\npotential  for  exploitation.  One  such  factor  is  the  potential  for  pressure,  coercion, \\nexploitation,  or  duress.  In  that  regard,  it  is  important  to  realize  that  Applicant  never \\nintended to, and did not, leave the U.S. to enter any of the foreign countries, and that \\nhis  sole  intent  was  to  have  individuals  travel  to  the  U.S.  for  brief  visits  to  explore \\npossible continuing relationships. In fact, none of those foreign women ever entered the \\nU.S., and their sole purpose was seemingly to scam money from Applicant. Yes, he did \\nsend the women substantial sums of money, but any “relationships” that he might have \\ndeveloped with them ceased in 2010 or 2011, at least four years before the SOR was \\nissued.  In  those  circumstances,  there  is  very  little  potential  for  pressure,  coercion, \\nexploitation, or duress.  \\n\\n \\nApplicant’s  immediate  family  and  extended  family  still  reside  in  the  U.S.,  and \\nthose  foreign  women  still  remain  overseas  without  any  continuing  contact  with \\nApplicant.  There  is  no  risk,  much  less  a  “heightened  risk,”  of  foreign  exploitation, \\ninducement,  manipulation,  pressure,  or  coercion  to  disqualify  Applicant  from  holding  a \\nsecurity  clearance  because  of  any  close  or  continuing  relationship  with  those  foreign \\nwomen.  While  Applicant  may  have  been  somewhat  naive,  and  displayed  a  lack  of \\njudgment, in falling for scams and sending such large sums of money to strangers, I am \\npersuaded that Applicant’s loyalty to the United States is steadfast and undivided, and \\nthat he has “such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that [he] \\ncan be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.” AG ¶¶ \\n8(a), 8(b), and 8(f) apply. \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n13 \\n\\n                                      \\n \\n\\n\f",
       "Whole-Person Concept \\n \\n \\nUnder  the  whole-person  concept,  the  administrative  judge  must  evaluate  an \\napplicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s \\nconduct  and  all  the  circumstances.  The  administrative  judge  should  consider  the  nine \\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  \\n \\n\\nthe  nature,  extent,  and  seriousness  of \\nto \\n\\nthe \\nthe  conduct;  (2) \\n(1) \\ncircumstances  surrounding \\ninclude  knowledgeable \\nparticipation;  (3)  the  frequency  and  recency  of  the  conduct;  (4)  the \\nindividual’s  age  and maturity  at  the  time  of the  conduct;  (5)  the  extent to \\nwhich  participation \\nthe  presence  or  absence  of \\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \\nfor  the  conduct;  (8)  the  potential  for  pressure,  coercion,  exploitation,  or \\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \\n\\nthe  conduct, \\n\\nis  voluntary;  (6) \\n\\n \\nUnder AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \\nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have evaluated the various \\naspects  of this  case  in  light  of the  totality  of  the  record evidence and have  not merely \\nperformed a piecemeal analysis.41       \\n\\nThere  is  some  evidence  against  mitigating  Applicant’s  use  of  information \\ntechnology  systems,  personal  conduct,  and  foreign  influence  concerns.  Applicant  was \\ninvoluntarily  terminated  from  his  employment  due  to  “violation  of  company  policy”  and \\n“unauthorized  use  of  GFE  for  sexually  explicit  or  sexually  oriented  materials.”  The  IT \\nscan  of  Applicant’s  GFE  revealed  that  he  viewed  an  “inappropriate”  online  dating \\nwebsite,  and on one occasion  in  July  2010, he  opened  two  unsolicited  e-mails,  one of \\nwhich  happened  to  contain  photos  of  nude  women,  and  the  other  of  which  contained \\nsomething  that  he  considered  “offensive.”  In  2009  and  2010,  he  engaged  in  long-\\ndistance online and telephone relationships with several women who were foreign-born \\nresidents of various countries. He sent them various sums of money, estimated to be a \\ntotal  in  excess  of  $60,000,  allegedly  earmarked  by  the  recipients  for  transportation, \\nmedical care, support, and release from a customs.  \\n\\nThe  mitigating  evidence  under  the  whole-person  concept  is  more  substantial. \\nApplicant’s alleged behavior occurred over four and one-half years before the SOR was \\nissued, and there is no evidence of subsequent conduct of a similar nature. There is no \\nevidence  of  a  personality  disorder.  Applicant  has  a  good  reputation  for  reliability, \\ntrustworthiness,  good  moral  character,  integrity,  discretion,  loyalty,  honesty,  efficiency, \\nprofessionalism,  problem-solving  skills,  and  a  strong  work  ethic.

The  motion  was \\ngranted.1 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nFindings of Fact \\n\\n \\nApplicant is a 33-year-old security guard who is being sponsored for a security \\nclearance  by  a  federal  contractor.  He  first  began  working  for  that  contractor  in  about \\nFebruary  2010,  but  subsequently  has  been  employed  by  other  companies.  He \\ngraduated  from  high  school  in  2002,  attended  college  without  earning  a  degree,  and \\nqualified as an emergency medical technician (EMT). From 2002 to 2008, he served in \\nthe  Army  National  Guard,  achieved  the  grade  of  specialist  (E-4),  and  received  an \\nhonorable discharge. He deployed to Iraq from January 2007 to February 2008. He is \\ndivorced  and  has  a  child  who  is  nine  years  old.  He  was  first  granted  a  security \\nclearance in 2004.2 \\n \\n\\nThe  SOR  alleged  under  Guideline  K  that  Applicant  committed  three  security \\nviolations in 2010 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.c). Under Guideline E, the SOR alleged the he was \\ncharged with assault on a family member in 2009 (SOR ¶ 2.a); that he was terminated \\nfrom a job during a probationary period in 2009 (SOR ¶ 2.b); that he was counseled for \\nneglect of duty and falsification in 2009 (SOR ¶ 2.c); that he illegally gained access to a \\nhotel in 2009 (SOR ¶ 2.d); that he was returned early from an overseas assignment and \\nplaced  on  probation  in  2010  (SOR  2.e);  and  that  he  falsified  his  responses  to  two \\nquestions in an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) (SOR ¶¶ \\n2.f and 2.g). The allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.c were also cross-alleged under Guideline \\nE in a single allegation (SOR ¶ 2.h). In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the \\nallegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.c, and 2.a-2.e, did not respond to the allegation in SOR ¶ \\n2.h, and denied the remaining allegations.3 \\n \\n                                                           \\n\\n1 Tr. 10-11, 42. \\n\\n2 Tr. 5-6, 62, 65, 92-93, 102-104; GE 1, 2. \\n\\n3 Applicant’s Answer to the SOR. \\n\\n \\n2 \\n \\n \\n\\n\f",
       "SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.c,  2.e,  and  2.h  –  three  security  violations  in  a  two-month \\nperiod,  being  returned  from  an  overseas  assignment  without  completing  a \\ncontract,  and  being  placed  on  probation  in  2010.  From  March  to  April  2010, \\nApplicant worked as a security guard for a company [hereafter referred to as “Company \\nA”]  at  an  overseas  location.  In  that  job,  his  duties  included  verifying  the  eligibility  of \\nthose seeking access to controlled spaces and classified information. \\n\\n \\nOn March 1, 2010, a team leader at Company A issued a memorandum for the \\nrecord (MFR) that reflected Applicant closed, but did not lock, a safe in a secured space \\nand failed to record properly the opening and closing of the safe and the logging in and \\nout of classified documents. (Allegation in SOR 1.a). Applicant was counseled to ensure \\nthat  all  procedures  were  followed,  especially  those  concerning  the  safeguarding  of \\nclassified \\ninstances  of  unsatisfactory \\nperformance  would  result  in  more  severe  corrective  action.  The  MFR  reflected  it  was \\nplaced in “personnel file,” but it does not contain Applicant’s signature or any indication \\nthat he was shown it or informed about it.4 \\n\\ninformation,  and  admonished \\n\\nthat \\n\\nfurther \\n\\n \\nApplicant testified that he never willfully violated any security protocol that was \\nproperly  explained  to  him.  This  incident  occurred  soon  after  he  began  working  for \\nCompany A. He arrived at the overseas location less than 48 hours before the incident. \\nIt happened his first day on the job. He claimed that he was not given proper guidance \\non the opening and closing of the safe. The safe was not secure because he failed to \\nspin the lock dial. The safe was located in a secure room and the classified information \\nwas not subject to compromise. Additionally, a person cleared for classified information \\nsigned out a document, but Applicant did not know there was a part of the document \\nthat he was required to fill out. He acknowledged that he made mistakes because he did \\nnot ask enough questions and stated he did not thereafter make those same mistakes \\nagain.5 \\n \\nOn March 10, 2010, a team leader at Company A issued a MFR that reflected \\nApplicant failed to follow orders by permitting a non-cleared worker to have access to \\nthe controlled access area (CAA) without verifying the worker was on the CAA access \\nroster. (Allegation in SOR ¶ 1.b). Applicant was questioned about this security violation \\nand  stated  that  he  recognized  the  worker.  The  MFR  noted  that  the  worker  had  just \\nreturned from a leave of absence and had not yet been placed back on the CAA access \\nroster.  The  MFR  also  indicated  that  it  would  serve  as  a  written  reprimand  of \\nunsatisfactory performance. The MFR reflected it was placed in “personnel file,” but it \\ndoes  not  contain  Applicant’s  signature  or  any  indication  that  he  was  shown  it  or \\ninformed about it.6 \\n                                                           \\n\\n4 GE 2, 3. \\n\\n5 Tr. 13, 21-34, 41; GE 2; Applicant’s Answer to the SOR. \\n\\n6 GE 2, 4. Interestingly, the text of the MFR issued on April 19, 2010, referred to an incident that \\n\\noccurred on May 17-18, 2010. An email attached to the MFR corrected those dates to April 17-18, 2010. \\n\\n \\n3 \\n \\n \\n\\n\f",
       "Applicant testified that this was his second day working at a particular post. He \\nstated  that  he  read  the  wrong  weekly  CAA  access  roster  at  the  post  and  the  non-\\ncleared worker was listed on that roster. This was an outdated access roster. Applicant \\nclaimed  that,  due  to  a  clerical  error,  the  individual  was  not  added  to  the  most  recent \\naccess roster. He claimed he recognized the individual as being a person on the access \\nroster from the previous day, but that was the wrong access roster. When the error was \\ndiscovered,  the  old  roster  was  taken  away  and  a  new  roster  was  issued  with  the \\nindividual in question added to it. Applicant stated his team leader  was upset that he \\nhad not checked the latest access roster. He was counseled for this incident, but did not \\nremember receiving a written warning at that time.7 \\n\\n \\nOn  April  19,  2010,  a  team  leader  at  Company  A  issued  a  MFR  that  reflected \\nApplicant failed to conduct properly a page inventory of classified documents on April \\n17,  2010.  (Allegation  in  SOR  ¶  1.c).  The  MFR  noted  that  two  of  the  documents  had \\nbeen  previously  combined  and  another  had  48  pages  removed  for  destruction. \\nApplicant’s  inventory  failed  to  account  for  the  missing  pages.  He  was  asked  how  he \\nconducted the inventory and responded by saying he conducted a page-by-page count. \\nWhen asked to explain the discrepancy involving the missing pages, he acknowledged \\nhis mistake. The MFR reflected it was placed in “personnel file,” but it does not contain \\nApplicant’s signature or any indication that he was shown it or informed about it.8 \\n\\n \\n \\nIn his background interview, Applicant stated that he counted the pages. At the \\nhearing, he testified that every week a  document inventory was conducted and every \\nmonth a more extensive page-by-page document inventory was conducted. He stated \\nthat he made the mistake of believing this inventory was the weekly document inventory \\ninstead  of  the  monthly  page-by-page  inventory.  He  claimed  the  team  leader  had \\nimproperly taken the missing pages and stored them in his room without logging them \\nout.  He  believed  the  team  leader  was  setting  a  trap  for  the  guard  conducting  the \\ninventory.  This  incident  resulted  in  a  conflict  between  him  and  the  team  leader.  He \\ncontacted the program manager and reported that the team leader improperly handled \\ndocuments. He also indicated that he wrote a detailed rebuttal to the counseling.9 \\n \\n \\nShortly after the incident on April 17, 2010, Applicant was sent home before the \\ncompletion  of  his  contract.  A  payroll  document  reflected  “[h]e  is  on  probation.  Please \\nhold  pay.”  (Allegation  in  SOR  ¶  2.e).  He  stated  that  he  received  all  of  the  written \\nwarnings/reprimands when he was leaving this overseas location. He further stated that \\nhe was so upset about being sent home that he did not read the documents that were \\ngiven to him. He did not consider his return to the United States as a termination. His \\nprogram  manager  led  him  believe  that  he  was  sent  back  because  of  the  personality \\n                                                           \\n\\n7 Tr. 34-42; GE 2; Applicant’s Answer to the SOR. \\n\\n8 GE 2, 5.

This is \\nalso the company that is currently sponsoring Applicant for a security clearance.10 \\n \\nSOR ¶ 2.a – charged with assault on family member in 2009. On January 9, \\n \\n2009, Applicant was issued a summons to appear in court for the charge of assault on a \\nfamily member, a Class 1 misdemeanor. On April 28, 2009, Applicant pleaded not guilty \\nto the charge. The court found there were sufficient facts to establish guilt but deferred \\nadjudication  for  one  year.  He  was  required to attend anger-management  classes  and \\navoid committing any offenses. In April 2011, the charge was dismissed.11 \\n \\n \\nIn  his  e-QIP,  Applicant  disclosed  this  charge.  He  testified  that  his  ex-wife  was \\nstriking him during an argument. He tried to block her hands but accidently hit her on \\nthe side of the head with an open hand. He testified that he never hit his ex-wife before \\nor after that incident.12 \\n \\n\\nSOR ¶ 2.b – termination from a job during a probationary period in March \\n2009.  In  his  e-QIP,  Applicant  disclosed  that  he  was  terminated  from  a  security  guard \\nposition with Company B near the end of a six-month probationary period. Company B \\nwas  not  required  to  provide  an  explanation  for  the  termination  during  that  period.  He \\nnoted that he was accused of wearing an earbud linked to an unauthorized MP3 player \\nwhile at work. He stated the earbud was for a cell phone that was permitted. He also \\nindicated  that  this  incident  happened  about  a  month  before  his  probationary  period \\nended, and he was never written up for this incident.13  \\n\\n \\nApplicant testified that he believed that he was terminated from the probationary \\nposition because of the pending domestic-violence charge. If he was convicted of the \\ncharge, he would have been prohibited from carrying a firearm at work. If he continued \\nto  work  for  Company  B  beyond  the  probationary  period,  he  would  have  become  a \\nmember of the employee’s union and the company would have had to hire an attorney \\nto  remove  him  from  the  job  if  he  could  no  longer  carry  a  firearm.    He  indicated  the \\nemployer was willing to rehire him after the domestic-violence charge was dismissed.14  \\n\\n \\nSOR  ¶  2.c  –  counseled  for  neglect  of  duty  and  falsification  in  September \\n2009.

Usually the guards would rotate between the posts each night. On the night in \\nquestion, however, the schedule did not rotate the guards between the posts. Applicant \\nand  the  other  guard  assumed  their  assignments  were  rotated  and  stood  them  in  that \\nmanner. In doing so, they signed the logs for the wrong posts. He claimed no dereliction \\nof duty occurred because both posts were properly manned. The other guard also was \\nwritten up for this discrepancy.16 \\n\\n \\nSOR ¶ 2.d – illegally gained access to hotel by opening a sliding door in \\n2009. While working for Company C overseas from July to December 2009, Applicant \\nresided in a hotel. The hotel was connected to a mall. There was a sliding door from the \\nmall  to  the  hotel.  After  a  certain  time  each  night,  the  door  was  secured.  On  two \\noccasions, Applicant went through the sliding door after it was secured. He claimed that \\nhe was given permission from the guard in the mall to use the door on both occasions. \\nAfter the second occasion, the hotel management was upset and threatened to kick out \\nall of the U.S. contractors from the hotel. Company C agreed to send Applicant back to \\nthe United States to appease the hotel. He acknowledged that he was given a written \\nwarning because of this incident. He also stated that he did not consider it a termination \\nbecause he was told it was not his fault and the company would find him another job. \\nHe met with a company representative for another job opportunity overseas, but soon \\nthereafter his father passed away and his mother was in the hospital, which precluded \\nhim  from  taking  that  job.  In  his  e-QIP,  he  did  not  list  the  reason  for  termination  of \\nemployment with Company C. Two months later he accepted employment with another \\nemployer, Company A.17 \\n\\n \\nSOR ¶¶ 2.f and 2.g – falsification allegations. Applicant submitted his e-QIP \\non October 14, 2010.

The question in Paragraph 2 asked, “Have \\nyou received a written warning, been officially reprimanded, suspended, or disciplined \\nfor  misconduct  in  the  workplace.”  The  question  in  Paragraph  3  asked,  “Have  you \\nreceived  a  written  warning,  been  officially  reprimanded,  suspended,  or  disciplined  for \\nviolating a security rule or policy.” Of note, Applicant responded “Yes” to the question in \\nParagraph 1 of Section 13C that asked if, for example, he had even been fired, left a job \\nunder  unfavorable  circumstances  or  been  laid  off,  checked  the  block  “laid  off,”  and \\ndisclosed  his  termination  of  employment  during  the  six-month  probationary  period \\ndiscussed in SOR ¶ 2.b, above.18 \\n                                                           \\n\\n15 GE 2 at 13-15. \\n\\n16 Tr. 72-77.   \\n\\n17 Tr. 77-84, 88-92; GE 2 at 11-13; Applicant’s Answer to the SOR.   \\n\\n18 GE 1.   \\n\\n \\n6 \\n \\n \\n\\n\f",

He acknowledged that he made a mistake in \\ncompleting the e-QIP, but claimed the errors were accidental. Because of the way the \\nwritten warnings were presented to him and what the program manager had told him, \\nhe  did  not  believe  the  warnings  were  actually  filed  and  they  were  not  something  that \\nstuck in his mind.19  \\n \\n \\nApplicant admitted that he also made a mistake in failing to disclose in his e-QIP \\nthe  written  warning  he  received  for  the  2009  incident  as  set  forth  in  SOR  ¶  2.c. \\n(Allegation \\nthe  written \\nwarning/reprimand and wrote a lengthy rebuttal to it.

The reprimand was \\nissued because he reported late to work. In the interview, he claimed he did not list that \\nemployment and the reprimand on his e-QIP because he forgot about them.22   \\n \\n \\nIn  his  background  interview,  Applicant  acknowledged  receiving  a  written \\ndisciplinary action for making an incorrect log entry.

When  asked  about  the  offense  during  his  background \\ninterview, he initially stated he received a written warning.

These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \\nrecognizing  the  complexities  of  human  behavior,  these  guidelines  are  applied  in \\nconjunction  with  an  evaluation  of  the  whole  person.  An  administrative  judge’s \\nadjudicative  goal  is  a  fair,  impartial,  and  commonsense  decision.

       "The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \\naccess  to  classified  information.  This  relationship  transcends  normal  duty  hours  and \\nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \\npossible  risk  that  the  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  safeguard \\nclassified  information.  Such  decisions  entail  a  certain  degree  of  legally  permissible \\nextrapolation  of  potential,  rather  than  actual,  risk  of  compromise  of  classified \\ninformation. Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in \\nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. \\nOr.  10865  §  7.  See  also  Executive  Order  12968  (Aug.  2,  1995),  Section  3.  Thus,  a \\nclearance  decision  is  merely  an  indication  that  the  Applicant  has  or  has  not  met  the \\nstrict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing \\na clearance. \\n\\n \\nInitially,  the  Government  must  establish,  by  substantial  evidence,  conditions  in \\nthe  personal  or  professional  history  of  the  applicant  that  may  disqualify  the  applicant \\nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \\nof  establishing  controverted  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  See  Egan,  484  U.S.  at  531.  \\n“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. \\nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \\npresume  a  nexus  or  rational  connection  between  proven  conduct  under  any  of  the \\ncriteria listed and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \\n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \\n\\n \\nOnce  the  Government  establishes  a  disqualifying  condition  by  substantial \\nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \\nfacts.

       "(g) any failure to comply with rules for the protection of classified or other \\nsensitive information; and  \\n \\n(h)  negligent  or  lax  security  habits  that  persist  despite  counseling  by \\nmanagement.  \\n \\n \\nIn early 2010, Applicant committed a number of security violations that resulted in \\nhim  being  issued  written  warnings  and  being  returned  early  from  an  overseas \\nassignment. AG ¶¶ 34(g) and 34(h) apply. \\n \\n \\n¶ 35: \\n \\n\\nThere are three handling of protected information mitigating conditions under AG \\n\\n(a)  so  much  time  has  elapsed  since  the  behavior,  or  it  happened  so \\ninfrequently  or  under  such  unusual  circumstances,  that  it  is  unlikely  to \\nrecur  and  does  not  cast  doubt  on \\nreliability, \\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;  \\n \\n(b) the individual responded favorably to counseling or remedial security \\ntraining and now demonstrates a positive attitude toward the discharge of \\nsecurity responsibilities; and \\n \\n(c)  the security violations were due to improper or inadequate training. \\n\\nindividual’s \\n\\nthe \\n\\n \\n \\nAs  the  Appeal  Board  has  stated,  once  it  is  established  that  an  applicant  has \\ncommitted security violations, he or she has a “very heavy burden” of persuasion as to \\nmitigation.  Such  violations  “strike  at  the  heart  of  the  industrial  security  program.” \\nAccordingly,  a  judge  must  give  any  claims  of  reform  or  rehabilitation  “strict  scrutiny.” \\nISCR Case No. 11-09219 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 31, 2014).   \\n \\n \\nThe conduct in question happened over six years ago. While Applicant has not \\ncommitted any other security violation since then, this conduct should not be considered \\nin  isolation,  but  should  be  examined  in  relation  to  his  other  questionable  conduct  as \\nalleged under Guideline E. When viewed in  that manner, I am unable to find that his \\nconduct  happened  so  long  ago,  was  so  infrequent,  or  occurred  under  unusual \\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur. In reaching this conclusion, I also considered \\nthat the security violations happened shortly after he started a new job and he claimed \\nhe had not received adequate training. Nevertheless, I find that his security violations \\ncontinue  to  cast  doubt  on  his  reliability,  trustworthiness,  and  good  judgment.  None  of \\nthe mitigating conditions fully apply.  \\n \\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \\n \\n\\n \\n\\nAG ¶ 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct:  \\n \\n\\n \\n10 \\n \\n \\n\\n\f",
       "Conduct  involving  questionable  judgment,  lack  of  candor,  dishonesty,  or \\nunwillingness  to  comply  with  rules  and  regulations  can  raise  questions \\nabout  an  individual's  reliability,  trustworthiness  and  ability  to  protect \\nclassified information. \\n \\nAG  ¶  16  describes  conditions  that  could  raise  security  concerns  and  may  be \\n\\ndisqualifying in this case:  \\n\\n \\n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \\nany  personnel  security  questionnaire,  personal  history  statement,  or \\nsimilar  form  used  to  conduct  investigations,  determine  employment \\nqualifications,  award  benefits  or  status,  determine  security  eligibility  or \\ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;  \\n \\n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \\nnot  sufficient  for  an  adverse  determination  under  any  other  single \\nguideline,  but  which,  when  considered  as  a  whole,  supports  a  whole-\\nperson  assessment  of  questionable \\njudgment,  untrustworthiness, \\nunreliability,  lack  of  candor,  unwillingness  to  comply  with  rules  and \\nregulations,  or  other  characteristics  indicating  that  the  person  may  not \\nproperly safeguard protected information; and \\n \\n(d)  credible  adverse  information  that  is  not  explicitly  covered  under  any \\nother  guideline  and  may  not  be  sufficient  by  itself  for  an  adverse \\ndetermination,  but  which,  when  combined  with  all  available  evidence \\ninformation  supports  a  whole-person  assessment  of  questionable \\njudgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to \\ncomply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that \\nthe  person  may  not  properly  safeguard  protected  information.  This \\nincludes  but  is  not  limited  to  consideration  of:  (1)  untrustworthy  or \\nunreliable behavior. . . ; (3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; (4) \\nevidence of significant misuse of Government or other employer’s time or \\nresources. \\n \\nI  did  not  find  Applicant’s  testimony  convincing  that  he  forgot  about  the  written \\nwarnings he received for the security violations in 2010 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.c), or the written \\ncounseling he received for dereliction of duty and falsification of a document in 2009. \\nThe security violations happened about six month before he submitted his e-QIP. Due \\nto  those  security  violations,  he  was  sent  home  from  an  overseas  location,  placed  on \\nprobation, and was not employed for the intervening six months. It is not believable that \\nhe would have forgotten about those recent events when he submitted his e-QIP at the \\nstart of his next job. His claim that he did not have the records or written warnings with \\nhim  when  he  submitted  the  e-QIP  is  likewise  not  persuasive.  I  find  that  Applicant \\ndeliberately falsified his 2010 e-QIP when he failed to disclose those written warnings \\nand counseling. AG ¶ 16(a) applies.  \\n\\n \\n11 \\n \\n \\n\\n\f",

The  action  was  taken  under  Executive  Order  10865,  Safeguarding \\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \\nDefense  Directive  5220.6,  Defense  Industrial  Personnel  Security  Clearance  Review \\nProgram  (January  2,  1992),  as  amended  (Directive);  and  the  adjudicative  guidelines \\n(AG) effective within the Department of Defense after September 1, 2006.  \\n\\n  \\nOn July 11, 2014, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a decision on the \\n \\nrecord.

He had 30 days from his receipt of \\nthe  FORM  to  submit  additional  information  in  response  to  the  FORM.  Applicant \\nrequested  an  extension  until  October  19,  2015,  to  submit  matters  in  response  to  the \\nFORM.

       "Findings of Fact \\n\\n \\n\\nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admits to all SOR allegations.  (Item 2)    \\n\\n \\n \\n \\nApplicant  is  a  43-year-old  employee  of  a  DOD  contractor  seeking  to  obtain  a \\nsecurity clearance. He has worked for his current employer since July 2011. Previously, \\nhe owned his own construction company from October 2007 to July 2011. He has been \\nmarried and divorced twice. He is currently married to his third wife and has a five-year-\\nold son and a three-year-old daughter. He also has a stepson. (Item 3; Item 12)   \\n\\n \\nOn  July  20,  2011,  Applicant  submitted  an  electronic  questionnaire \\n\\nfor \\ninvestigation  processing  (e-QIP).  (Item  3)  A  subsequent  background  investigation \\nrevealed  Applicant  encountered \\nfinancial  problems.  Specifically,  Applicant  was \\napproximately $95,326 past due on a mortgage (SOR ¶ 1.a: Item 6 at 2; Item 7 at 2); he \\nowed a $654 judgement entered against him in November 2009 on behalf of a hospital \\n(SOR  ¶  1.b:  Item  6  at  1;  Item  7  at  1;  Item  9  at  1);  and  he  filed  for  bankruptcy  under \\nChapter  7  in  June  2010.  The  Chapter  7  bankruptcy  was  converted  to  a  Chapter  13 \\nbankruptcy. (SOR ¶ 1.c: Item 5 at 1; Item 6 at 1; Item 7 at 1; Item 10).   \\n\\n \\nIn  his  response  to  the  SOR,  dated  December  11,  2014,  Applicant  admits  to  all \\nallegations,  but  claims  the  debts  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.b  are  included  in  his \\nbankruptcy.    The  Chapter  13  bankruptcy  repayment  plan  required  him  to  pay  $164 \\npayments over a period of 60 months. Applicant indicated he is timely making payments \\nand will continue to do so until the plan is complete in August 2015. (Item 2 at 6)  \\n\\n \\nIn a response to Interrogatories, dated July 15, 2013, Applicant indicated that he \\nfiled for bankruptcy because of his divorce from his second wife in 2009 and as a result \\nof business deal that went bad. He built seven houses for a contractor and was never \\npaid.  He  believes  one  of  the  creditors  (a  mortgage)  included  in  his  bankruptcy  is  the \\nsame as the mortgage alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a. (Item 4 at 9)  \\n\\n \\nApplicant  received  financial  counseling  as  a  requirement  of  his  bankruptcy \\nprocess.  (Item  4  at  13,  25-29)  In  July  2013,  he  also  completed  a  personal  financial \\nworksheet.  His  net  monthly  income  was  $2,851.  He  had  $2,297  in  total  monthly \\nexpenses. After expenses, he had $554 left over in discretionary income. (Item 4 at 22)  \\n\\n \\nIn his response to the FORM, Applicant provided all of his Chapter 13 bankruptcy \\npaperwork. He completed his payment plan and the Chapter 13 bankruptcy is complete. \\nHe  provided  a  copy  of  the  Discharge  of  Debtor  After  Completion  of  Chapter  13  Plan, \\ndated  September  28,  2015.  He  provided  a  copy  of  his  payment  history.  He  also \\nprovided a portion of a TransUnion credit report which indicates the debt alleged in SOR \\n¶  1.b  was  included  in  the  Chapter  13  bankruptcy.  He  is  still  not  sure  where  the \\nmortgage debt came from. It is no longer on his credit report and his attorney assures \\nhim that it was included in the bankruptcy.

       "He said he has made his share of mistakes, but has done everything he could to \\nrectify  the  situation.    Everything  he  does  is  motivated  by  making  his  children’s  lives \\nbetter.  He  explained  he  became  bankrupt  as  a  result  of  his  previous  job  in  the \\nconstruction  business.  Applicant  built  houses.  His  business  partners  backed  out  when \\nthe real estate business slowed down and left Applicant with thousands of unpaid bills. \\nAt  the  same  time,  his  ex-wife  incurred  some  bills  that  he  could  not  afford  to  repay. \\nApplicant is now able to pay his bills. His pay has increased an additional $8 an hour. \\n(Item 12) \\n   \\n\\nPolicies \\n\\n \\n\\nWhen  evaluating  an  applicant’s  suitability \\n\\n \\nthe \\nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \\nintroductory  explanations  for  each  guideline,  the  adjudicative  guidelines  list  potentially \\ndisqualifying  conditions  and  mitigating  conditions,  which  must  be  considered  when \\ndetermining an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. \\n\\nfor  a  security  clearance, \\n\\n \\nThese  guidelines  are  not  inflexible  rules  of  law.  Instead,  recognizing  the \\ncomplexities  of  human  behavior,  these  guidelines  are  applied  in  conjunction  with  the \\nfactors  listed  in  the  adjudicative  process.  The  administrative  judge’s  overarching \\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 2(c), \\nthe  entire  process  is  a  conscientious  scrutiny  of  a  number  of  variables  known  as  the \\n“whole-person  concept.”  The  administrative  judge  must  consider  all  available,  reliable \\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \\ndecision. \\n\\n \\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) \\nrequires  that  “[a]ny  doubt  concerning  personnel  being  considered  for  access  to \\nclassified  information  will  be  resolved  in  favor  of  national  security.”  In  reaching  this \\ndecision,  I  have  drawn  only  those  conclusions  that  are  reasonable,  logical,  and  based \\non the evidence contained in the record.  \\n\\n \\nUnder  Directive  ¶  E3.1.14,  the  Government  must  present  evidence  to  establish \\ncontroverted  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  Under  Directive  ¶  E3.1.15,  the  applicant  is \\nresponsible  for  presenting  “witnesses  and  other  evidence  to  rebut,  explain,  extenuate, \\nor  mitigate  facts  admitted  by  applicant  or  proven  by  Department  Counsel.  .  .  .”  The \\napplicant  has  the  ultimate  burden  of  persuasion  as  to  obtaining  a  favorable  security \\ndecision.  \\n\\nthe  Government  predicated  upon \\n\\n \\nA  person  who  seeks  access  to  classified  information  enters  into  a  fiduciary \\nrelationship  with \\ntrust  and  confidence.  This \\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \\nGovernment  reposes  a  high  degree  of  trust  and  confidence  in  individuals  to  whom  it \\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \\nthe  possible  risk  the  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  protect  or \\nsafeguard  classified  information.  Such  decisions  entail  a  certain  degree  of  legally \\n\\n \\n3 \\n \\n \\n\\n\f",
       "permissible  extrapolation  as  to  potential,  rather  than  actual,  risk  of  compromise  of \\nclassified information. \\n\\n  \\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of \\nthe  national  interest  and  shall  in  no  sense  be  a  determination  as  to  the  loyalty  of  the \\napplicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \\n \\n\\n \\n\\nAnalysis \\n\\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \\n\\nout in AG &amp; 18:       \\n \\n\\nFailure  or  inability  to  live  within  one=s  means,  satisfy  debts,  and  meet \\nfinancial  obligations  may  indicate  poor  self-control,  lack  of  judgment,  or \\nunwillingness  to  abide  by  rules  and  regulations,  all  of  which  can  raise \\nquestions  about  an  individual=s  reliability,  trustworthiness  and  ability  to \\nprotect  classified \\nfinancially \\noverextended  is  at  risk  of  having  to  engage  in  illegal  acts  to  generate \\nfunds.  \\n\\ninformation.  An \\n\\nindividual  who \\n\\nis \\n\\n \\n\\nThe  guideline  notes  several  disqualifying  conditions  that  could  raise  security \\nconcerns. I find AG &amp;19(a) (an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); and AG &amp;19(c) \\n(a  history  of  not  meeting  financial  obligations)  apply  to  Applicant’s  case.  Applicant \\nencountered  financial  problems  since  2008,  which  resulted  in  a  bankruptcy  filing  in \\n2010.   \\n \\nAn  individual  who  is  financially  irresponsible  may  also  be  irresponsible, \\nunconcerned, or careless in their obligations to protect classified information. Behaving \\nirresponsibly in one aspect of life provides an indication of how a person may behave in \\nother  aspects  of  life.  A  person’s  relationship  with  his  creditors  is  a  private  matter  until \\nevidence  is  uncovered  demonstrating  an  inability  or  unwillingness  to  pay  debts  under \\nagreed  terms.  Absent  evidence  of  strong  extenuating  or  mitigating  circumstances,  an \\napplicant with a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk \\ninconsistent with the holding of a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be \\ndebt free, but is required to manage his finances in such a way as to meet his financial \\nobligations.  \\n\\n \\nThe  Government’s  substantial  evidence  and  Applicant’s  own  admissions  raise \\nsecurity  concerns  under  Guideline  F.  The  burden  shifted  to  Applicant  to  produce \\nevidence  to  rebut,  explain,  extenuate,  or  mitigate  the  security  concerns.  (Directive \\n¶E3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden \\nof  disproving  it  never  shifts  to  the  Government.

       "The  guideline  also  includes  examples  of  conditions  that  could  mitigate  security \\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions potentially \\napply:  \\n \\nAG  &amp;  20(a)  (the  behavior  happened  so  long  ago,  was  so  infrequent,  or \\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \\ncast  doubt  on  the  individual’s  current  reliability,  trustworthiness,  or  good \\njudgment);  \\n \\nAG  &amp;  20(b)  (the  conditions  that  resulted  in  the  financial  problem  were \\nlargely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \\ndownturn,  unexpected  medical  emergency,  or  a  death,  divorce  or \\nseparation),  and \\nthe \\ncircumstances);  \\n \\nAG  ¶  20(c)  (the  person  has  received  or  is  receiving  counseling  for  the \\nproblem  and/or  there  are  clear  indications  that  the  problem  is  being \\nresolved or is under control);  \\n\\nresponsibly  under \\n\\nthe \\n\\nindividual  acted \\n\\n  \\n\\nAG  &amp;  20(d)  (the  individual  initiated  a  good-faith  effort  to  repay  overdue \\ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts); and   \\n\\n \\n\\nAG &amp;20(e) (the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \\nof  the  past-due  debt  which  is  the  cause  of  the  problem  and  provides \\ndocumented  proof  to  substantiate  the  basis  of  the  dispute  or  provides \\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue). \\n \\nApplicant’s  financial  problems  were  caused  by  a  business  downturn  and \\nexpenses  related  to  his  divorce  from  his  second  wife  in  2009.

AG ¶¶ 20(a) and 20(b) apply.  \\n\\n \\nAG &amp; 20(c) applies. Applicant was required to attend financial counseling as part \\nof  his  bankruptcy.    He  completed  financial  counseling  as  well  as  the  terms  of  his \\nChapter 13 repayment plan. Applicant’s financial situation is now under control.  \\n\\n \\nAG &amp; 20(d) applies because Applicant demonstrated he made a good-faith effort \\ntowards  resolving  his  delinquent  accounts.    He  completed  his  Chapter  13  repayment \\nplan.  All  payments  were  made  on  a  timely  basis.    AG  &amp;  20(e)  is  applicable  because \\nApplicant disputed the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b, claiming they were part of \\n\\n \\n5 \\n \\n \\n\\n\f",
       "his  bankruptcy.  The  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.b  was  verified  to  be  a  part  of  his \\nbankruptcy. The mortgage debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a is no longer on his credit report.  \\n\\n \\nApplicant  resolved  any  doubts  raised  by  his  financial  situation.  He  successfully  \\n\\ndemonstrated that his financial situation is under control.  \\n \\nWhole-Person Concept \\n \\n \\nUnder  the  whole-person  concept,  the  administrative  judge  must  evaluate  an \\napplicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s \\nconduct  and  all  the  circumstances.  The  administrative  judge  should  consider  the  nine \\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  \\n \\n\\nthe  conduct, \\n\\nis  voluntary;  (6) \\n\\nthe  nature,  extent,  and  seriousness  of \\nto \\n\\nthe  conduct;  (2) \\nthe \\n(1) \\ninclude  knowledgeable \\ncircumstances  surrounding \\nparticipation;  (3)  the  frequency  and  recency  of  the  conduct;  (4)  the \\nindividual’s  age  and maturity  at  the  time  of the  conduct;  (5)  the  extent to \\nwhich  participation \\nthe  presence  or  absence  of \\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \\nfor  the  conduct;  (8)  the  potential  for  pressure,  coercion,  exploitation,  or \\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \\n \\n \\nUnder  AG  ¶  2(c),  the  ultimate  determination  of  whether  to  grant  eligibility  for  a \\nsecurity  clearance  must  be  an  overall  commonsense  judgment  based  upon  careful \\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \\n        \\n\\nI  considered  the  potentially  disqualifying  and  mitigating  conditions  in  light  of  all \\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered several circumstances \\nbeyond  Applicant’s  control  adversely  affected  his  finances,  including  divorce  and  the \\nreal estate downturn that adversely affected his construction business. He successfully \\ncompleted  his  Chapter  13  repayment  plan  and  his  financial  situation  has  stabilized. \\nApplicant mitigated the security concerns raised under financial considerations.  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \\n\\n \\n\\nFormal Findings \\n\\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \\n\\nSubparagraphs 1.a – 1.c:   \\n\\nFor Applicant \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nFOR APPLICANT \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n6 \\n \\n \\n\\n\f",

He has a history of \\nfinancial  delinquencies,  including  delinquent  debts  owed  to  eight  creditors  in  the \\napproximate  amount  of  $37,847.  While  Applicant  has  either  resolved  or  is  making \\npayments  on  five  of  his  debts,  he  failed  to  establish  that  three  others  are  being \\naddressed. Applicant has  not mitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns \\nbecause he has failed to show he  acted responsibly with respect to  these outstanding \\ndebts. He mitigated the Foreign Influence security concerns created by his mother, two \\nsisters, and three brothers, who are all citizens and residents of Vietnam. Eligibility for \\naccess to classified information is denied.  \\n \\n\\nStatement of the Case \\n\\n \\n\\nOn  December  5,  2014,  the  Defense  Office  of  Hearings  and  Appeals  (DOHA) \\nissued  a  Statement  of  Reasons  (SOR)  to  Applicant  detailing  security  concerns  under \\nGuideline  F,  Financial  Considerations  and  Guideline  B,  Foreign  Influence.  The  action \\nwas  taken  under  Executive  Order  (EO)  10865,  Safeguarding  Classified  Information \\nwithin  Industry  (February  20,  1960),  as  amended;  Department  of  Defense  Directive \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n1 \\n\\n\f",
       "5220.6,  Defense  Industrial  Personnel  Security  Clearance  Review Program  (January  2, \\n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective for cases \\nafter September 1, 2006. (Item 1.) \\n\\n \\nApplicant responded to the SOR (Answer) on January 11, 2015 and February 2, \\n \\n2015. (Item 1.) He requested that his case be decided by an administrative judge on the \\nwritten  record.  Department  Counsel  submitted  the  Government’s  written  case  on  April \\n21,  2016.  A  complete  copy  of  the  File  of  Relevant  Material  (FORM),  containing  five \\nItems, was received by Applicant on April 27, 2016. He was afforded an opportunity to \\nfile objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation within 30 days \\nof  his  receipt of  the  FORM.  Applicant  submitted documents  marked  Applicant  Exhibits \\n(AE) A through K in response to the FORM within the 30-day period that ended May 27, \\n2016.  Department  Counsel  had  no  objection  to  AE  A  through  AE  K,  and  they  are \\nadmitted into the record. DOHA assigned the case to me on December 13, 2016.  \\n \\n\\nProcedural Rulings \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nIn  the  FORM,  the  Government  requested  I  take  administrative  notice  of  certain \\nfacts  relating  to  Vietnam.  Department  Counsel  provided  a  five-page  summary  of  the \\nfacts,  supported  by  five  Government  documents  pertaining  to  Vietnam,  identified  as \\nItem  6.  The  documents  provide  elaboration  and  context  for  the  summary.  I  take \\nadministrative  notice  of  the  facts  included  in  the  U.S.  Government  reports.  They  are \\nlimited to matters of general knowledge, not subject to reasonable dispute. They are set \\nout in the Findings of Fact. \\n\\n \\n\\nFindings of Fact \\n\\n \\n \\nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations in subparagraphs 2.a and 2.b. He failed \\nto explicitly admit or deny SOR subparagraph 1.a through 1.h, and as a result, they will \\nbe treated as denials. (Item 1.) After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, and \\nexhibits, I make the following findings of fact. \\n \\n \\nApplicant is 51 years old. He was born in Vietnam and immigrated to the United \\nStates. He attended a U.S. high school. He became a U.S. citizen in 1981.  He earned \\nan  associate’s  degree  in  1984  from  a  U.S.  college.  He  was  employed  by  a  federal \\ncontractor from February 2011 until he was laid off in February 2013. He is married to a \\nU.S. citizen, and has two children who are U. S. citizens. (Item 2.) \\n \\n \\napproximate amount of $37,847. His debts are as follows. \\n \\n \\nApplicant  is  delinquent  on  his  $257,199  primary  mortgage  in  the  amount  of \\n$10,420,  as  alleged  in  SOR  subparagraph  1.a.  He  presented  documentation  showing \\nhe made payments of $2,085 to this creditor on December 26, 2014, January 20, 2015, \\nand  May  14,  2016.  He  indicated  in  a  letter  that  he  was  trying  to  bring  this  account \\ncurrent. However, he failed to establish a regular payment history and document that he \\nbrought this debt current. It remains unresolved. (Item 1; AE A; AE B.) \\n\\nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleges Applicant is indebted to eight creditors in the \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n2 \\n\\n\f",
       "Applicant  was  delinquent  on  a  $17,986  second  mortgage  in  the  amount  of \\n \\n$2,295, as  alleged  in SOR  subparagraph 1.b.  He  presented a  letter  from this  creditor, \\ndated March 15, 2015, which reflected this debt was paid in full on March 11, 2016. It is \\nresolved. (Item 1; AE C.) \\n \\n \\nApplicant was indebted on a charged-off credit card in the amount of $20,632, as \\nalleged in SOR subparagraph 1.c. He presented a letter from this creditor, dated March \\n9, 2013, which reflected this debt was paid in full. It is resolved. (Item 1; AE D.) \\n \\n \\nApplicant was delinquent on an $11,935  vehicle loan in the amount of $618, as \\nalleged in SOR subparagraph 1.d. Applicant presented a copy of a receipt for a check in \\nthe  amount  of  $710,  dated  April  29,  2016,  and  an  account  statement  that  shows \\nApplicant’s loan was current as of March 30, 2016, with an unpaid balance of $7,422.50 \\nremaining on the loan. Applicant is current on this debt. (Item 1; AE E; AE F.)  \\n \\n \\nApplicant  is  indebted  on  a  charged-off  account  in  the  amount  of  $2,654,  as \\nalleged in SOR subparagraph 1.e. He produced a written payment agreement with this \\ncreditor,  which  shows  he  agreed  to  make  monthly  payments  of  $100.  He  produced \\ndocumentation that shows he made one $100 payment on May 14, 2016.  This debt is \\nbeing resolved. (AE H.) \\n \\n \\nApplicant is indebted on a charged-off account in the amount of $530, as alleged \\nin SOR subparagraph 1.f. Applicant produced no documentation that corresponds with \\nthis account. It is unresolved. (Item 5.) \\n \\nApplicant is indebted on a charged-off account in the amount of $409, as alleged \\n \\nin  SOR  subparagraph  1.g.  Applicant  produced  a  letter  from  a  collection  agent  on  this \\naccount, which offered to settle this debt for a payment of $229.06. He failed to produce \\ndocumentation  to  show  he  made  any  payments  to  the  creditor  under  this  agreement. \\n(AE K.)  \\n \\n \\nApplicant  was  indebted  on  a  charged-off  account  in  the  amount  of  $289,  as \\nalleged  in  SOR  subparagraph  1.h.  Applicant  presented  a  receipt  dated  May  20,  2016, \\nwhich shows Applicant paid this debt. It is resolved. (AE J.) \\n \\n \\nApplicant  attributed  his  delinquencies  to  a  reduction  of  hours  at  his  previous \\nemployer, his wife’s unemployment, and his current unemployment. He also noted that \\nhe was aiding his daughter with her university expenses. (AE A.) Applicant provided no \\nrecent household budget showing monthly household expenses, although an April 2013 \\npersonal financial statement showed his expenses exceeded his income by more than \\n$1,000 per month. (Item 3.) He did not provide a copy of his current earnings statement. \\nWithout updated information, I am unable to assess his current financial status, and his \\nability  or  willingness  to  repay  his  remaining  delinquent  debt  and  avoid  future \\ndelinquencies. The record lacks any evidence of credit or financial counseling.  \\n \\n \\nUnder  Guideline  B,  the  SOR  alleges  Applicant’s  mother,  two  sisters,  and  three \\nbrothers  are  citizens  and  residents  of  Vietnam.  Applicant’s  mother  is  unemployed.  He \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n3 \\n\\n\f",
       "communicates  with  her  on  a  monthly  basis  by  phone  and  sees  her  yearly,  when  she \\nvisits  the  United  States.  One  of  Applicant’s  sisters  is  a  waitress,  and  the  other  is  a \\nconstruction  helper.  Applicant’s  brothers  are  unemployed.  Applicant  has  not  seen  his \\nsiblings  in  person  since  1997.  He  communicates  with  them  approximately  once  per \\nmonth.  None  of  his  relatives  in  Vietnam  is  employed  by  the  Vietnamese  government. \\nHis family members in Vietnam are not aware he has applied for a security clearance. \\n(Item 3.)  \\n \\n \\nVietnam is an authoritarian state ruled by the Communist Party of Vietnam. The \\nVietnamese Government arbitrarily arrests and detains individuals for political activities. \\nThe  Government  limits  freedom  of  speech,  religion,  and  the  press.  U.S.  citizens  have \\nbeen detained after traveling in the area of closed borders with China, Cambodia, and \\nLaos.  By  Vietnamese  law,  anyone  born  to  at  least  one  Vietnamese-citizen  parent  is \\nconsidered to be a Vietnamese citizen. (Item 6.) \\n \\n\\nPolicies \\n\\n \\n\\nWhen  evaluating  an  applicant’s  suitability \\n\\n \\nthe \\nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \\nintroductory  explanations  for  each  guideline,  the  adjudicative  guidelines  list  potentially \\ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \\napplicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. \\n \\n\\nfor  a  security  clearance, \\n\\nThese  guidelines  are  not  inflexible  rules  of  law.  Instead,  recognizing  the \\ncomplexities  of  human  behavior,  administrative  judges  apply  the  guidelines  in \\nconjunction with the factors listed in AG ¶ 2(a), describing the adjudicative process. The \\nadministrative \\nimpartial,  and \\ncommonsense  decision.  According  to  AG  ¶ 2(c),  the  entire  process  is  a  conscientious \\nscrutiny  of  a  number  of  variables  known  as  the  “whole-person  concept.”  The \\nadministrative  judge  must  consider  all  available,  reliable  information  about  the  person, \\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \\n\\njudge’s  overarching  adjudicative  goal \\n\\nis  a \\n\\nfair, \\n\\n \\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) \\nrequires  that  “[a]ny  doubt  concerning  personnel  being  considered  for  access  to \\nclassified  information  will  be  resolved  in  favor  of  national  security.”  In  reaching  this \\ndecision,  I  have  drawn  only  those  conclusions  that  are  reasonable,  logical,  and  based \\non the evidence contained in the record.  \\n\\n \\nUnder  Directive  ¶  E3.1.14,  the  Government  must  present  evidence  to  establish \\ncontroverted  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  Under  Directive  ¶  E3.1.15,  the  applicant  is \\nresponsible  for  presenting  “witnesses  and  other  evidence  to  rebut,  explain,  extenuate, \\nor  mitigate  facts  admitted  by  the  applicant  or  proven  by  Department  Counsel.”  The \\napplicant  has  the  ultimate  burden  of  persuasion  to  obtain  a  favorable  clearance \\ndecision.  \\n\\n \\nA  person  who  seeks  access  to  classified  information  enters  into  a  fiduciary \\ntrust  and  confidence.  This \\n\\nthe  Government  predicated  upon \\n\\n \\nrelationship  with \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n4 \\n\\n\f",
       "relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \\nGovernment  reposes  a  high  degree  of  trust  and  confidence  in  individuals  to  whom  it \\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \\nthe  possible  risk  the  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  protect  or \\nsafeguard  classified  information.  Such  decisions  entail  a  certain  degree  of  legally \\npermissible  extrapolation  as  to  potential,  rather  than  actual,  risk  of  compromise  of \\nclassified information. \\n \\n\\nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be “in terms of the \\nnational  interest  and  shall  in  no  sense  be  a  determination  as  to  the  loyalty  of  the \\napplicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \\n \\n\\nAnalysis \\n\\nThe  security  concern  for  Financial  Considerations  is  set  out  in  AG  ¶  18,  as \\n\\nfollows:       \\n \\n\\nFailure  or  inability  to  live  within  one’s  means,  satisfy  debts,  and  meet \\nfinancial  obligations  may  indicate  poor  self-control,  lack  of  judgment,  or \\nunwillingness  to  abide  by  rules  and  regulations,  all  of  which  can  raise \\nquestions  about  an  individual’s  reliability,  trustworthiness  and  ability  to \\nprotect  classified \\nfinancially \\noverextended  is  at  risk  of  having  to  engage  in  illegal  acts  to  generate \\nfunds.  \\n \\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise a security concern under \\n\\ninformation.  An \\n\\nindividual  who \\n\\nis \\n\\nAG ¶ 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \\n \\n\\n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \\n \\n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \\n\\n \\n \\nApplicant  had  a  history  of  financial  delinquencies  that  he  had  been  unable  to \\nresolve,  including  delinquent  debts  to  eight  creditors  in  the  approximate  amount  of \\n$37,847,  as  alleged  in  the  SOR.  The  Government  established  the  disqualifying \\nconditions in AG ¶ 19(a) and 19(c). Further inquiry about the applicability of mitigating \\nconditions is required.  \\n \\n \\napplicable:  \\n\\nFive Financial Considerations mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially \\n\\n \\n(a)  the  behavior  happened  so  long  ago,  was  so  infrequent,  or  occurred \\nunder  such  circumstances  that  it  is  unlikely  to  recur  and  does  not  cast \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n5 \\n\\n\f",
       "is \\n\\nthe  cause  of \\n\\ndoubt  on  the  individual’s  current  reliability,  trustworthiness,  or  good \\njudgment; \\n \\n(b)  the  conditions  that  resulted  in  the  financial  problem  were  largely \\nbeyond  the  person’s  control  (e.g.,  loss  of  employment,  a  business \\ndownturn,  unexpected  medical  emergency,  or  a  death,  divorce  or \\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \\n \\n(c)  the  person  has  received  or  is  receiving  counseling  for  the  problem \\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \\nunder control;  \\n \\n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \\notherwise resolve debts; and \\n \\n(e)  the  individual  has  a  reasonable  basis  to  dispute  the  legitimacy  of  the \\npast-due  debt  which \\nthe  problem  and  provides \\ndocumented  proof  to  substantiate  the  basis  of  the  dispute  or  provides \\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \\n \\n \\nApplicant has not acted responsibly, or in a timely manner, to attempt to resolve \\nhis remaining delinquent debt. His debt is current and on-going as demonstrated by the \\nunresolved debts in SOR subparagraphs 1.a, 1.f, and 1.g. Applicant’s conduct does not \\nwarrant application of AG ¶ 20(a).  \\n \\nApplicant’s debts, which were identified in the SOR, may have been due, in part, \\n \\nto his unemployment and underemployment and his wife’s unemployment. However, he \\nalso  made  the  decision  to  pay  for  his  daughter’s  university  education,  instead  of  his \\nprimary  mortgage  and  other  debts.  Further,  he  failed  to  demonstrate  responsible \\nbehavior  toward  those  accounts  that  remain  unresolved.  AG  ¶  20(b)  is  only  partially \\nmitigating. \\n \\n \\nApplicant  provided  no  evidence  of  the  depth  or  duration  of  any  financial \\ncounseling.  There  are  no  clear  indications  that  his  delinquent  debts  in  subparagraphs \\n1.a,  1.f,  and  1.g  are  being  resolved  or  are  under  control.  Mitigation  under  AG  ¶  20(c) \\nhas not been established. \\n \\n \\nApplicant  resolved  the  debts  in  subparagraphs  1.b,  1.c,  and  1.h,  and  is  making \\npayments  toward  the  resolution  of  the  debts  in  subparagraphs  1.d  and  1.e.  Mitigation \\nunder AG ¶ 20(d) applies in part to the debts identified in subparagraphs 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, \\n1.e, and 1.h. \\n \\n \\nAG  ¶  20(e)  requires  Applicant  to  provide  documented  proof  to  substantiate  the \\nbasis of any dispute or provide evidence of actions to resolve the issue. Applicant has \\nnot  provided  evidence  of  any  formal  dispute  or a basis for one.  Mitigation  under  AG  ¶ \\n20(e) has not been established. \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n6 \\n\\n\f",

Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \\n\\n \\n(a)  contact  with  a  foreign  family  member,  business  or  professional \\nassociate,  friend,  or  other  person  who  is  a  citizen  of  or  resident  in  a \\nforeign  country  if  that  contact  creates  a  heightened  risk  of  foreign \\nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \\n \\n(b)  connections  to  a  foreign  person,  group,  government,  or  country  that \\ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual’s obligation to \\nprotect  sensitive  information  or  technology  and  the  individual’s  desire  to \\nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information. \\n \\nApplicant’s  mother  and  five  siblings  are  Vietnamese  citizens  and  reside  in  the \\n  \\nVietnam. Due to his ties to his family, and the threats present in Vietnam as set out in \\nItem  6,  a  heightened  risk  of  foreign  exploitation,  inducement,  manipulation,  pressure, \\nand  coercion  is  present.  The  evidence  is  sufficient  to  raise  the  above  disqualifying \\nconditions. \\n \\n \\nof the mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 8 including: \\n \\n\\nAG ¶ 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \\n\\n(a) the nature of the relationship with foreign persons, the country in which \\nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \\nthat  country  are  such  that  it  is  unlikely  the  individual  will  be  placed  in  a \\nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \\ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.;  \\n \\n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual’s sense of \\nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \\nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n7 \\n\\n\f",
       "and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \\nconflict of interests in favor of the U.S. interests; and \\n \\n(c)  contact  or  communication  with  foreign  citizens  is  so  casual  and \\ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \\ninfluence or exploitation. \\n \\nApplicant  maintains  relationships  with  his  mother  and  siblings,  who  are  citizens \\nand residents of Vietnam. His contact with his mother is the most frequent. The Appeal \\nBoard has held that there is a rebuttable presumption that ties with immediate family are \\nnot  casual.1  The  evidence  shows  that  Applicant  maintains  his  relationship  with  his \\nmother  during  the  year  through  phone  calls  and  her  annual  visits.  He  also  maintains \\nregular contact with his siblings, although that contact is not as frequent as it is with his \\nmother. While none of Applicant’s foreign family members are aware of his request for a \\nsecurity  clearance,  given  these  facts  and  Applicant's  close  ties  to  his  foreign  family \\nmembers, I cannot confidently conclude that Applicant could not be placed in a position \\nof having to choose between the interests of foreign individuals and the interests of the \\nUnited States. AG ¶ 8 (a) and (c) do not apply. \\n\\n \\n Applicant  has  established  deep  and  longstanding  relationships  in  the  United \\nStates. He spent a formative part of his youth in the U.S and attended college here. He \\nchose  to  stay  in  the  United  States  after  finishing  his  education.  He  became  a  U.S. \\ncitizen.  He  is  married  to  an  American  citizen.  His  children  are  U.S.  citizens.  Applicant \\ncan  be expected  to  resolve  any  conflict  of  interest  in favor  of  the  United  States.  AG  ¶ \\n8(b) is mitigating. \\n \\nWhole-Person Concept \\n \\n \\nUnder  the  whole-person  concept,  the  administrative  judge  must  evaluate  an \\napplicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s \\nconduct  and  all  relevant  circumstances.  The  administrative  judge  should  consider  the \\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  \\n \\n\\nthe  nature,  extent,  and  seriousness  of \\nto \\n\\nthe  conduct;  (2) \\nthe \\n(1) \\ncircumstances  surrounding \\ninclude  knowledgeable \\nparticipation;  (3)  the  frequency  and  recency  of  the  conduct;  (4)  the \\nindividual’s  age  and maturity  at  the  time  of the  conduct;  (5)  the  extent to \\nwhich  participation \\nthe  presence  or  absence  of \\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \\nfor  the  conduct;  (8)  the  potential  for  pressure,  coercion,  exploitation,  or \\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \\n\\nthe  conduct, \\n\\nis  voluntary;  (6) \\n\\n \\nUnder AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant  eligibility for a security \\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \\nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \\n\\n                                                           \\n1 ISCR Case No. 00-0484 at 4-5 (App. Bd.

       " \\n\\nI  considered  the  potentially  disqualifying  and  mitigating  conditions  in  light  of  all \\nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \\nGuidelines F and B in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were \\naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. The Foreign \\nInfluence  concerns  related  to  Applicant’s  mother  and  siblings,  who  are  citizens  and \\nresidents  in Vietnam, are mitigated. However,  Applicant has not acted in a trustworthy \\nmanner  when  it  comes  to  addressing  his  financial  delinquencies.  There  is  insufficient \\nevidence  to  demonstrate  that  recurrence  of  financial  irresponsibility  is  unlikely.  The \\npotential for pressure, coercion, or duress remains undiminished. \\n\\n \\nOverall,  the  record  evidence  leaves  me  with  questions  and  doubts  as  to \\nApplicant’s  eligibility  and  suitability  for  a  security  clearance.

       "The Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On\\nAugust 19, 2015, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\\ndecision–security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of\\nDefense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a decision\\non the written record.  On June 27, 2016, after considering the record, Defense Office of Hearings\\nand Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Martin H. Mogul denied Applicant’s request for a\\nsecurity clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive ¶¶ E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\\n\\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in making findings\\nof fact and whether the Judge’s decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent\\nwith the following, we affirm.\\n\\nThe Judge’s Findings of Fact  \\n\\nApplicant is 46 years old, married, and has four children.  He earned a bachelor’s degree in\\n1994.    Since  2010,  he  has  been  employed  by  a  defense  contractor.    In  his  security  clearance\\napplication, he explained that he encountered difficultly paying bills in 2008 after being laid off\\nfrom a second job due to the company’s bankruptcy.  He gave no explanation for why he did not\\nbegin attempting to resolve the debts until the issuance of the SOR.\\n\\nApplicant admitted each of the five delinquent debts alleged in the SOR.  For the debt in\\nSOR  ¶  1.a  for  about  $500,  Applicant  wrote  in  his  Response  to  Department  Counsel’s  File  of\\nRelevant Material (FORM) that the debt was paid off.  The creditor agreed to accept three monthly\\npayments of about $100 to settle the debt.  A document showed the creditor made arrangements with\\nApplicant to debit electronically about $100 from his account in September 2015 for this debt.  For\\nthe 2009 judgment in SOR ¶ 1.b for about $14,000, Applicant indicated that, at the time he answered\\nthe SOR, he was unable to negotiate a settlement.  In his Response to the FORM, he provided\\ndocuments showing his wages were being garnished biweekly for the next six months for this debt\\nand about $350 was garnished from his pay at the end of November 2015.  No evidence was\\npresented to establish the total amount deducted from his pay or how much is still owed on that debt. \\nFor the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 1.b, and 1.c for about $2,500, $5,600, and $3600, Applicant wrote in\\nhis Response to the FORM that he is currently on a schedule to repay between $150 and $190 a\\nmonth on each debt until it is resolved.  He provided proof of payments toward those debts from\\nSeptember through November 2015.\\n\\nThe Judge’s Analysis\\n\\nThe  Judge  found  Applicant  did  not  act  responsibly  because,  even  though  he  has  been\\nemployed by his current employer since 2010, he only began making payments towards the debts\\nafter the SOR was issued.  The Judge also concluded that, while the mitigation condition concerning\\nthe initiation of a good-faith effort to repay the creditors was applicable, it was not controlling\\nbecause Applicant must establish a consistent history of continuing to resolve his debts. \\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\n2\\n\\n\f",
       "In the appeal brief, Applicant provided character reference letters and documents showing\\npayments  on,  or  settlement  of,  various  debts.    Most  of  those  documents,  however,  were  not\\npreviously submitted to the Judge and constitute new evidence that the Appeal Board is prohibited\\nfrom receiving or considering.  Directive ¶ E3.1.29.  \\n\\nApplicant claims the Judge erred in the findings of fact.  For example, he states that he has\\nsix children (instead of four) and started working for his current employer in 2012 (instead of 2010). \\nIn  his  security  clearance  application,  however,  Applicant  listed  that  he  had  four  children  and\\nindicated he started working for his employer in 2010.  He failed to establish that the Judge erred\\nin the findings of fact.  Our review reveals the Judge’s material findings are based upon substantial\\nevidence or constitute reasonable inferences or conclusions that could be drawn from the record\\nevidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-03420 at 3 (App. Bd. July 25, 2014).  Applicant also argues\\nthat he mitigated the security concerns arising from his debts.  His arguments are not sufficient to\\nshow that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to\\nlaw.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-06634 at 2 (App. Bd. Apr. 28, 2016).   \\n   \\n\\nThe Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the\\ndecision.  The decision is sustainable on this record.  “The general standard is that a clearance may\\nbe granted only when ‘clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.’” Department\\nof the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  See also Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b):  “Any doubt\\nconcerning personnel being considered for access to classified information will be resolved in favor\\nof the national security.”\\n\\nThe Decision is AFFIRMED.  \\n\\nOrder\\n\\nSigned: Michael Ra’anan        \\nMichael Ra’anan\\nAdministrative Judge\\nChairperson, Appeal Board\\n\\nSigned: James E.

(Item\\n1.)  The  action  was  taken  under  Executive  Order  10865,  Safeguarding  Classified\\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\\nDirective  5220.6,  Defense  Industrial  Personnel  Security  Clearance  Review  Program\\n(January  2,  1992),  as  amended  (Directive);  and  the  adjudicative  guidelines  (AG)\\neffective within the Department of Defense after September 1, 2006. \\n\\n \\nOn September 12, 2015, Applicant replied to the SOR (RSOR) in writing, and he\\nrequested that his case be decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. (Item 1.)\\nOn  October  27,  2015,  Department  Counsel  issued  the  Department's  written  case.  A\\ncomplete  copy  of  the  file  of  relevant  material  (FORM)  was  provided  to  Applicant  on\\nNovember  4,  2015.  In  the  FORM,  Department  Counsel  offered  six  documentary\\nexhibits. (Items 1-6.) Applicant was given the opportunity to file objections and submit\\nmaterial in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. A response was due by December 10,\\n2015. Applicant submitted additional evidence, which has been identified and entered\\ninto  evidence  as  Items  A  through  G.  The  case  was  assigned  to  this  Administrative\\n\\n1\\n\\n\f",
       "Judge on January 5, 2016. Based upon a review of the pleadings and exhibits, eligibility\\nfor access to classified information is denied.\\n\\nFindings of Fact\\n\\nAfter  a  complete  and  thorough  review  of  the  evidence  in  the  record,  including\\nApplicant's RSOR and the FORM, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make\\nthe following findings of fact: \\n\\nApplicant  is  46  years  old,  and  he  is  married  and  has  4  children.  He  earned  a\\nBachelor’s  degree  in  1994.  Applicant  has  been  employed  since  2010  as  a  Computer\\nOperator by his current employer,  a defense contractor, and he seeks a DoD security\\nclearance in connection with his employment in the defense sector. (Items 2, F.)\\n\\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\\n\\nThe  SOR  lists  five  allegations  (1.a.  through  1.e.)  regarding  financial  difficulties,\\nspecifically  delinquent  debts,  under  Adjudicative  Guideline  F.  The  allegations  will  be\\ndiscussed below in the same order as they were listed on the SOR:\\n\\n1.a. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR for a collection account in the amount\\nof $518.  In his RSOR, Applicant admitted this SOR allegation. In his Post-FORM letter,\\nApplicant wrote that this debt had been paid off. Applicant also included a letter from the\\ncreditor indicating that they would accept three monthly payments of $104.48 to settle\\nthis debt. (Item A.) Item E shows that the creditor made an arrangement with Applicant\\nto debit electronically $104.48 from Applicant’s account on September 11, 2015, for this\\ndebt.\\n\\n1.b. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR for a judgement filed against Applicant\\nin  April  2009,  in  the  amount  of  $14,892.    In  his  RSOR,  Applicant  admitted  this  SOR\\nallegation,  and  he  wrote  that  he  was  unable  to  negotiate  at  this  time.  (Item  1.)  In  his\\nPost-FORM letter, Applicant wrote that this judgment debt had been placed with a law\\nfirm that informed Applicant a portion of his wages would be garnished bi-weekly for the\\nnext  six  months.  (Item  A.)  Items  F  and  G  show  that  $357.73  was  deducted  from  the\\npaycheck of Applicant on November 29, 2015.  No evidence was introduced to establish\\nthe total amount that has been deducted from Applicant’s pay or how much is still owing\\non this debt. \\n\\n1.c. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR for a collection account in the amount\\nof $2,506. In his RSOR, Applicant admitted this SOR allegation. (Item 1.) In his Post-\\nFORM letter, Applicant wrote that he is currently on a payment schedule for this debt to\\npay $156.25 a month until this debt is resolved. (Item A.) Item E shows that Applicant\\nhas  made  one  payment  of  $163.75  on  September  14,  2015,  and  two  payments  of\\n$156.25 on October 14, 2015, and November 17, 2015, toward this debt.\\n\\n1.d. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR for a collection account in the amount\\nof $5,649. In his RSOR, Applicant admitted this SOR allegation. (Item 1.) In his Post-\\n\\n2\\n\\n\f",
       "FORM letter, Applicant wrote that he is currently on a payment schedule for this debt to\\npay $187.90 a month until this debt is resolved. (Item A.) Item D shows that Applicant\\nhas made three payments of $187.90 on September 28, 2015; October 26, 2015; and\\nNovember 23, 2015; and three additional payments of $104.48.\\n\\n1.e. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR for a collection account in the amount\\nof $3,677.  In his RSOR, Applicant admitted this SOR allegation. (Item 1.) In his Post-\\nFORM letter, Applicant wrote that he is currently on a payment schedule for this debt to\\npay $155 a month until this debt is resolved. (Item A.) Item C shows that Applicant has\\nmade two payments of $155 on October 26, 2015, and November 23, 2015, toward this\\ndebt.\\n\\nApplicant  completed  an  Electronic  Questionnaires  for  Investigations  Processing\\n(e-QIP) on July 26, 2011, and he explained each of his delinquent debts, writing, “In Year\\n2008, had difficulty paying bills due to being laid off at 2  job due to company file [sic]\\nbankruptcy.”  (Item  2.)  As  reviewed  above,  Applicant  began  working  at  his present\\nemployment in 2010, but he gave no explanation for why he did not begin attempting to\\nresolve his debts until  2015, after the SOR was issued. \\n\\nnd\\n\\nPolicies\\n\\nWhen  evaluating  an  applicant’s  suitability \\n\\nthe\\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\\nto  brief  introductory  explanations  for  each  guideline,  the  adjudicative  guidelines  list\\npotentially  disqualifying  conditions  and  mitigating  conditions,  which  are  useful  in\\nevaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information.\\n\\nfor  a  security  clearance, \\n\\nThese  guidelines  are  not  inflexible  rules  of  law.  Instead,  recognizing  the\\ncomplexities  of  human  behavior,  these  guidelines  are  applied  in  conjunction  with  the\\nfactors  listed  in  the  adjudicative  process.  The  administrative  judge’s  over-arching\\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 2(c),\\nthe  entire  process  is  a  conscientious  scrutiny  of  a  number  of  variables  known  as  the\\n“whole-person  concept.”  The  administrative  judge  must  consider  all  available,  reliable\\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\\ndecision.\\n\\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b)\\nrequires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\\ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this decision, I have\\ndrawn  only  those  conclusions  that  are  reasonable,  logical  and  based  on  the  evidence\\ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere\\nspeculation or conjecture.\\n\\nUnder  Directive  ¶  E3.1.14,  the  Government  must  present  evidence  to  establish\\ncontroverted  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  Under  Directive  ¶  E3.1.15,  the  Applicant  is\\nresponsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\\nmitigate  facts  admitted  by  applicant  or  proven  by  Department  Counsel.  .  .  .”  The\\n\\n3\\n\\n\f",
       "Applicant  has  the  ultimate  burden  of  persuasion  as  to  obtaining  a  favorable  security\\ndecision. \\n\\nA  person  who  seeks  access  to  classified  information  enters  into  a  fiduciary\\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government\\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\\nthe  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  protect  or  safeguard  classified\\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as\\nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\\n\\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of\\nthe  national  interest and  shall in no  sense be  a determination  as  to the  loyalty  of  the\\napplicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \\n\\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\\n\\nAnalysis\\n\\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\\n\\nout in AG ¶ 18:  \\n\\n      Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet\\nfinancial  obligations  may  indicate  poor  self-control,  lack  of  judgment,  or\\nunwillingness  to  abide  by  rules  and  regulations,  all  of  which  can  raise\\nquestions  about  an  individual’s  reliability,  trustworthiness  and  ability  to\\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \\n\\nThe  guideline  notes  several  conditions  that  could  raise  security  concerns  and\\ncould potentially apply in this case.  Under AG ¶ 19(a), “an inability or unwillingness to\\nsatisfy  debts,”  is  potentially  disqualifying.  Similarly  under  AG  ¶  19(c),  “a  history  of  not\\nmeeting  financial  obligations,”  may  raise  security  concerns.  I  find  that  both  of  these\\ndisqualifying  conditions  apply  to  Applicant  in  this  case.  The  evidence  has  established\\nthat Applicant accumulated significant delinquent debt several years ago.  \\n\\nAG ¶ 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns from financial\\ndifficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(b), it may be mitigating where, “the conditions that resulted in\\nthe financial problem were largely beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment,\\na  business  downturn,  unexpected  medical  emergency,  or  a  death,  divorce  or\\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.” As reviewed\\nabove,  some  of  Applicant’s  financial  difficulties  occurred  as  a  result  of  his  periods  of\\nunemployment. However, since Applicant has been employed by his current employer\\nsince 2010, and only began making payments toward the SOR debts after the SOR was\\n\\n4\\n\\n\f",
       "issued in 2015, I find that Applicant has not acted responsibly. Accordingly, I find that this\\nmitigating condition is not applicable in this case. \\n\\n¶  20(d)  is  now  applicable  but  not  controlling,  since  Applicant  has  begun  taking\\naction to “initiate a good-faith effort to repay his overdue creditors or otherwise resolve\\ndebts,”  because  even  though  he  has  been  working  at  his  present  employment  since\\n2010,  he  did  not  begin  this  process  until  after  the  SOR  was  issued  in  2015.  To  be\\napplicable and controlling in the future, Applicant must establish a consistent history of\\ncontinuing  to  resolve  these  delinquent  past  debts  and  not  become  past  due  on  his\\npresent debts. At this time, I find Guideline F against Applicant.\\n\\nWhole-Person Concept\\n\\nUnder  the  whole-person  concept,  the  administrative  judge  must  evaluate  an\\napplicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s\\nconduct  and  all  the  circumstances.  The  administrative  judge  should  consider  the  nine\\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a): \\n\\nthe  conduct, \\n\\nto \\n\\n(1)  the  nature,  extent,  and  seriousness  of  the  conduct;  (2)  the\\ncircumstances  surrounding \\ninclude  knowledgeable\\nparticipation;  (3)  the  frequency  and  recency  of  the  conduct;  (4)  the\\nindividual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\\nwhich  participation \\nthe  presence  or  absence  of\\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\\nfor  the  conduct;  (8)  the  potential  for  pressure,  coercion,  exploitation,  or\\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\\n\\nis  voluntary;  (6) \\n\\nUnder AG ¶ 2 (c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\\nsecurity  clearance  must  be  an  overall  commonsense  judgment  based  upon  careful\\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.      \\n\\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the\\nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. Based on all of the reasons cited above\\nas to why the mitigating conditions are not applicable at this time, I find that the record\\nevidence leaves me with significant questions and doubts as to Applicant’s eligibility and\\nsuitability  for  a  security  clearance  under  the  whole-person  concept.  For  all  these\\nreasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns under the whole-\\nperson concept. \\n\\nFormal Findings\\n\\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\\n\\nrequired by ¶ E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\\n\\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\\n\\nAGAINST APPLICANT\\n\\nSubparagraphs 1.a. - 1.e.:\\n\\nAgainst  Applicant\\n\\n5\\n\\n\f",

The facts administratively noticed are \\nsummarized in the Findings of Fact, below. \\n \\n\\nFindings of Fact \\n\\n \\n\\nApplicant  admitted  all  of  the  SOR  allegations.  He  is  a  39-year-old  analyst \\nemployed  by  a  defense  contractor  since  March  2015.  He  worked  for  a  prior  defense \\ncontractor,  at  a  U.S.  Embassy  overseas,  from  January  2008  to  February  2009.  He \\nworked for another defense contractor from August 2010 to November 2012. He was \\ngranted eligibility for a public trust position by another federal agency in 2008. He was \\ngranted a DOD security clearance in 2014.1  \\n\\n \\nApplicant  is  a  native-born  U.S. citizen  and  resident. He  obtained  a  high-school \\ndiploma in the United States in 1996 and a bachelor’s degree from a U.S. university in \\n2001. He was previously married from September 2009 to November 2010. As of the \\nhearing, he was engaged to a native-born U.S. citizen. He does not have any children.2 \\n\\n \\nApplicant enlisted and served as an active duty infantryman in the Israeli military \\nfrom November 2004 to February 2006. Upon completion of his service, he declined an \\noffer to serve in the Israeli military reserves and was honorably discharged. His primary \\nmotivation for serving in the Israeli military was to develop the skills and experience that \\nwould assist him in furthering a career in security in support of the U.S. Government. He \\ninitially desired to serve in the U.S. military, but learned when he spoke to recruiters that \\nhe  was  ineligible  due  to  a  longstanding  medical  condition.  He  explored  alternative \\noptions  to  serve  the  U.S.  Government  through  security  positions  with  defense \\ncontractors  and  in  the  private  sector,  but  discovered  that  all  such  positions  required \\nprior military experience. He did not inquire whether his medical condition would have \\ndisqualified him from holding these positions since he did not meet the requisite criteria \\nof  prior  military  service.  He  did  not  explore  options  that  did  not  require  prior  military \\n\\n                                                           \\n1 Applicant’s response to the SOR; Tr. at 24-25, 70-77; GEs 1-3; AE B.  \\n \\n2 Tr. at 55-125; GE 1. \\n \\n\\n \\n2 \\n \\n\\n\f",
       "experience because such positions would not have provided him with the opportunity to \\ndevelop skills in his desired field.3   \\n\\n \\nApplicant discovered through internet research a program designed for overseas \\nJewish volunteers who had an interest in serving in the Israeli military, so long as one \\nprovided evidence of Jewish heritage. He decided then, at the age of 23, that it was a \\nreasonable option for him to serve in the Israeli military given that the United States and \\nIsrael  were  allies  with  mutual  adversaries.  He  made  this  decision  on  his  own.  He \\ndiscussed  his  decision  with  his  parents,  and  their  conversations  revolved  primarily \\naround their concern for Applicant’s safety.4 \\n\\n \\nIn  2004,  Applicant  traveled  to  Israel  to  join  the  Israeli  military.  Acting  on  the \\nrecommendation  that  he  have  a  basic  proficiency  of  Hebrew  prior  to  enlistment, \\nApplicant  first  engaged  in  a  five-month  language  instruction  program.  The  language \\nprogram  was  not  affiliated  with  the  Israeli  military.  He  subsequently  enlisted  and  the \\nIsraeli military sent him to additional language training.5  \\n\\n \\nDuring the enlistment process, Applicant lied and told the Israeli military that he \\ndid  not  have  the  medical  condition  that  rendered  him  ineligible  to  serve  in  the  U.S. \\nmilitary. He did so because he was told, at an initial enlistment meeting when he arrived \\nin Israel, that his longstanding medical condition, combined with another of his medical \\nconditions, would have lowered his physical profile to such a degree that would have \\ndisqualified  him  from  serving  as  an  infantryman.  He  was  previously  unaware  of  this \\ninformation. He understood from his internet research prior to traveling to Israel that he \\nwould  be  permitted  to  serve  in  some  capacity  despite  his  medical  condition.  He  also \\nunderstood that his medical condition was not necessarily a disqualifier for joining the \\ninfantry.6  \\n\\n \\nApplicant  determined  that  while  he  was  unwilling  to  lie  to  the  U.S.  military  and \\ngovernment about this particular medical condition, it was acceptable for him to lie to \\nthe  Israeli  military  and  government  since  he  did  not  have  any  allegiance  to  them.  He \\nwas not concerned his medical condition would be discovered because he managed it \\nand  was  able  to  maintain  a  high  level  of  fitness.  He  disclosed  his  other  medical \\ncondition  and  medical  history to the  Israeli  military.  In the  13  years that  have  passed \\nsince his enlistment in the Israeli military, Applicant has matured. He understands now \\nthat he should have disclosed his longstanding medical condition to the Israeli military, \\neven if such a disclosure would have prevented him from serving as an infantryman.7   \\n  \\n                                                           \\n3 Tr. at 55-125; GEs 1-3; AEs A, C. \\n \\n4 Tr. at 55-125; GE 3.  \\n \\n5 Tr. at 55-125; GEs 2-3. \\n \\n6 Tr. at 55-125; GE 3. \\n \\n7 Tr. at 55-125; GE 3. \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n3 \\n \\n\\n\f",
       " \\nApplicant’s  ex-girlfriend  resides  in  Israel.  He  met  her  on  an  online  dating  site \\nwhen he attended the five-month language instruction program in Israel. He lived with \\nher while he was serving in the Israeli military. He last communicated with her in 2007. \\nWhen  Applicant  moved  back  to  the  United  States  from  Israel  in  2007,  he  had  social \\nmedia contact with her. He also had social media contact with her one sister who also \\nresides  in  Israel,  and  several  individuals  in  Israel  with  whom  Applicant  served  in  the \\nIsraeli  military,  to  include  his  unit  supervisor.  After  he  received  the  SOR,  Applicant \\ndeleted all of his foreign contacts on social media. He had not previously deleted them \\nbecause  he  consulted  and  was  advised  by  a  former  colleague  that  doing  so  at  once \\nmight trigger to any one of his foreign contacts who might be working in the intelligence \\nfield that he was pursuing a sensitive position. He ultimately decided that since he was \\nnot  in  communication  with  any  of  his  foreign  contacts,  he  did  not  need  to  maintain  a \\nsocial  media  connection  with  them.  Since  he  deleted  his  foreign  contacts  on  social \\nmedia, some have tried to reconnect with him but Applicant has not responded and has \\nno intentions of doing so.8 \\n  \\n \\nApplicant maintains contact with one individual, a U.S. citizen and resident, with \\nwhom Applicant served in the Israeli military. This individual is the founder and CEO of \\na civilian national service organization that has no connections to the Israeli government \\nor military. As an American Jew, this individual chose to serve in the Israeli military and \\ndid  so  for  two  years  in  the  same  unit  as  Applicant.  He  attested  that  both  he  and \\nApplicant  were  low-level  infantrymen.  Since  their  discharge  from  the  Israeli  military, \\nApplicant  and \\nindividual  see  each  other  once  yearly  and  communicate \\napproximately twice yearly.9 \\n \\nAfter  graduating  from  college  and  before  he  served  in  the  Israeli  military, \\n \\nApplicant took a trip to Israel in August 2002 through a birthright program. The program \\nhelped teach him about his Jewish culture. Subsequent to his Israeli military service and \\nduring a period of unemployment, he traveled to Israel in June 2010 through the same \\nbirthright  program.  On  this  occasion,  he  served  as  a  volunteer  male  counselor  to  the \\nprogram.  He  did  not  see  any  of  his  former  Israeli  military  contacts  or  his  ex-girlfriend \\nduring this trip. Both trips were comprised of U.S. citizens, all Jewish Americans, who \\nwanted  to  travel  to  Israel  to  learn  more  about  their  Jewish  culture.  He  has  not  since \\ntraveled  to  Israel.  Should  he  travel  to  Israel  or  any  foreign  country  in  the  future,  he \\nunderstands  as  a  security  clearance  holder  the  requirement  to  report  such  foreign \\ntravel.10 \\n \\n \\nApplicant did not have an Israeli security clearance when he served in the Israeli \\nmilitary. He has never been an Israeli citizen, as he was not required to become one in \\norder to serve in the Israeli military, and as such he has never held an Israeli passport. \\nHe chose not to become an Israeli citizen or obtain an Israeli passport because he did \\n\\nthis \\n\\n                                                           \\n8 Tr. at 55-125; GEs 1-3. \\n \\n9 Tr. at 55-125; GEs 1-3; AE F. \\n \\n10 Tr. at 55-125; GEs 1-3. \\n \\n\\n \\n4 \\n \\n\\n\f",

He rented two apartments in Israel as he was required to maintain a home of \\nrecord  during  the  course  of  his  Israeli  military  service.  Since  his  discharge  from  the \\nIsraeli military and move back to the United States, he has not received nor does he \\nexpect to receive any income or benefits from the Israeli government or military. He also \\nclosed his Israeli bank account.11  \\n \\n \\nUpon  his  discharge  from  the  Israeli  military,  Applicant  moved  back  to  and  has \\nsince lived in the United States. He resided with his parents from March 2006 through \\nJanuary 2008. He moved out of his parents’ home and rented at various locations from \\nJanuary 2008 until 2015. Since 2015, he and his fiancée have rented a place together.  \\nHe was briefly unemployed from February to May 2006, and again from November 2012 \\nto  July  2013.

His  parents,  sibling,  and \\nfiancée are native-born U.S. citizens and residents. His father worked for many years \\nfor a defense contractor. His fiancée, who works for the U.S. Government and holds a \\nDOD security clearance, testified that Applicant disclosed his Israeli military service to \\nher  when  they  met  in  May  2014.  She  described  Applicant  as  passionate  about  the \\nUnited  States.  Applicant’s  supervisor  also  testified  that  he  was  aware  of  Applicant’s \\nprior Israeli military service and described Applicant as an exceptional performer, with \\nno reason to question his character, integrity, or loyalty to the United States.

Strong bilateral relations have fueled and reinforced \\nsignificant  cooperation  between  the  United  States  and  Israel  on  defense-related \\nmatters. Aid for Israel has been designed to maintain Israel’s qualitative military edge \\nover neighboring militaries, since Israel must rely on better equipment and training to \\ncompensate for a manpower deficit in any potential regional conflict. However, U.S. aid \\nto  Israel  is  not  unlimited.  Sales  of  U.S.  defense  articles  and  services  to  Israel  are \\nsubject to the Arms Export Control Act (AECA) and the July 23, 1952, Mutual Defense \\n                                                           \\n11 Tr. at 55-125; GEs 1-3; AE F. \\n \\n12 Tr. at 55-125; GE 1. \\n \\n13 Tr. at 55-125; AEs D-E. \\n\\n \\n5 \\n \\n\\n\f",
       "Assistance Agreement between the United  States and Israel. AECA enumerates the \\npurposes  for  which  foreign  governments  can  use  U.S.  military  articles  and  limits  the \\nability of foreign governments to transfer U.S. military products to third party countries \\nwithout the prior consent of the President of the United States. The 1952 agreement \\nstates  that  the  government  of  Israel  assures  the  United  States  government  that \\nequipment, materials, or services acquired from the United States are required for and \\nwill  be  used  solely  to  maintain  Israel’s  internal  security  and  Israel’s  legitimate  self-\\ndefense.  \\n \\n \\nAlthough the United States has provided regular military support to Israel, there \\nis a significant documented history of classified information and controlled technologies \\nbeing illegally imported to Israel. These include parts used in fighter jets, spy software, \\ncomponents  for  certain  missiles  and  fighter  jet  aircraft,  digital  oscilloscopes  that  are \\ncapable of being utilized in the development of weapons of mass destruction and  in \\nmissile  delivery  fields,  a  product  containing  a  certain  chemical  precursor  that  is \\ncontrolled  for  chemical,  biological,  antiterrorism,  and  chemical  reasons,  pressure \\ntransducers  that  are  controlled  for  nuclear  non-proliferation  reasons,  encryption \\nsoftware  that  is  controlled  for  national  security  reasons,  and  classified  documents. \\nIllegal  technology  transfers,  even  to  private  Israeli  entities,  are  a  significant  concern \\nbecause  foreign  government  entities  have  learned  to  capitalize  on  private-sector \\ntechnology acquisitions.  \\n \\n \\nIn the past 30 years, there have been at least three cases in which employees \\nof the U.S. Government were convicted of disclosing classified information to Israel or \\nof  conspiracy  to  act  as  an  Israeli  agent.  Reports  indicate  that  concerns  regarding \\npossible Israeli espionage persist among U.S. officials. The most prominent espionage \\ncase is that of Jonathan Pollard. He pled guilty in 1986, with his then wife, to selling \\nclassified documents to Israel. Israel granted Pollard, who is serving a life sentence in \\na U.S. federal prison, citizenship in 1996 and, in 1998, acknowledged that Pollard had \\nbeen its agent. \\n \\n \\nA  travel  warning  issued  by  the  U.S.  Department  of  State  for  Israel,  the  West \\nBank, and Gaza remains in effect, as the security environment remains complex due to \\nheightened  tensions  and  security  risks.  U.S.  citizens  are  advised  that  all  persons \\nentering or departing Israel, the West Bank, or Gaza are subject to security screening, \\nand may be denied entry or exit. Israeli security officials have on occasion requested \\naccess  to  travelers’  personal  email  accounts  or  other  social  media  accounts  as  a \\ncondition  of  entry.  In  such  circumstances,  travelers  should  have  no  expectation  of \\nprivacy for any data stored on such devices or in their accounts. \\n  \\n\\n \\n\\nWhen  evaluating  an  applicant’s  suitability \\n\\n \\nthe \\nadministrative  judge  must  consider  the  adjudicative  guidelines.  In  addition  to  brief \\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \\ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \\napplicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. \\n\\nfor  a  security  clearance, \\n\\nPolicies \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n6 \\n \\n\\n\f",
       "These  guidelines  are  not  inflexible  rules  of  law.  Instead,  recognizing  the \\ncomplexities  of  human  behavior,  administrative  judges  apply  the  guidelines  in \\nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s \\noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \\nto  AG  ¶  2(a),  the  entire  process  is  a  conscientious  scrutiny  of  a  number  of  variables \\nknown  as  the  “whole-person  concept.”  The  administrative  judge  must  consider  all \\navailable,  reliable  information  about  the  person,  past  and  present,  favorable  and \\nunfavorable, in making a decision. \\n\\n \\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) \\nrequires  that  “[a]ny  doubt  concerning  personnel  being  considered  for  access  to \\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.”  \\n\\n \\nUnder Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \\ncontroverted  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  Under  Directive  ¶  E3.1.15,  the  applicant  is \\nresponsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \\nor  mitigate  facts  admitted  by  the  applicant  or  proven  by  Department  Counsel.”  The \\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \\n\\nthe  Government  predicated  upon \\n\\n \\nA  person  who  seeks  access  to  classified  information  enters  into  a  fiduciary \\n \\nrelationship  with \\ntrust  and  confidence.  This \\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \\nGovernment  reposes  a  high  degree  of  trust  and  confidence  in  individuals  to  whom  it \\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \\nthe  possible  risk  the  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  safeguard \\nclassified  information.  Such  decisions  entail  a  certain  degree  of  legally  permissible \\nextrapolation  of  potential,  rather  than  actual,  risk  of  compromise  of  classified \\ninformation. \\n \\n\\nSection 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be “in terms \\nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \\napplicant  concerned.”  See  also  Exec.  Or.  12968,  Section  3.1(b)  (listing  multiple \\nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \\n\\nAnalysis \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \\n \\n\\nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG ¶ 6:       \\n\\nForeign  contacts  and  interests,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  business, \\nfinancial,  and  property  interests,  are  a  national  security  concern  if  they \\nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \\nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \\nway  inconsistent  with  U.S.  interests  or  otherwise  made  vulnerable  to \\npressure  or  coercion  by  any  foreign  interest.  Assessment  of  foreign \\n\\n \\n7 \\n \\n\\n\f",
       "contacts  and  interests  should  consider  the  country  in  which  the  foreign \\ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \\nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \\nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \\n \\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \\n\\nAG ¶ 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \\n\\ninformation  or \\n\\n \\n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \\nor  professional  associate,  friend,  or  other  person  who  is  a  citizen  of  or \\nresident  in  a  foreign  country  if  that  contact  creates  a  heightened  risk  of \\nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \\n \\n(b)  connections  to  a  foreign  person,  group,  government,  or  country  that \\ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \\nprotect  classified  or  sensitive \\nthe \\nindividual’s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \\nthat information or technology. \\n \\nThe  nature  of  a  nation’s  government,  its  relationship  with  the  United  States, \\nand its human  rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant’s \\nfamily  members  are  vulnerable  to  government  coercion.  The  risk  of  coercion, \\npersuasion,  or  duress  is  significantly  greater \\nforeign  country  has  an \\nauthoritarian  government,  a  family member is associated with or dependent upon the \\ngovernment,  or  the  country  is  known  to  conduct  intelligence  operations  against  the \\nUnited  States.  In  considering  the  nature  of  the  government,  an  administrative  judge \\nmust  also  consider  any  terrorist  activity  in  the  country  at  issue.  See  generally  ISCR \\nCase  No.  02-26130  at  3  (App.  Bd.  Dec.  7,  2006)  (reversing  decision  to  grant \\nclearance  where  administrative  judge  did  not  consider  terrorist  activity  in  area  where \\nfamily members resided). \\n \\n\\ntechnology  and \\n\\nif \\n\\nthe \\n\\nAG  ¶  7(a)  requires  substantial  evidence  of  a  “heightened  risk.”  The \\n“heightened  risk” required to raise one of these disqualifying conditions is a relatively \\nlow standard.  “Heightened risk” denotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in \\nhaving a family member living under a foreign government. \\n\\n \\nApplicant has not communicated with his ex-girlfriend in Israel since 2007. When \\nApplicant moved back to the United States from Israel in 2007, he had limited social \\nmedia contact with her, her one sister, and several other individuals in Israel with whom \\nhe served in the Israeli military. He deleted all of his social media foreign contacts after \\nhe received the SOR. He has not responded and has no intentions of responding to any \\nattempts  by  these  foreign  contacts  to  reconnect  on  social  media.  While  Applicant \\nmaintains  contact with one individual  with  whom he served in the Israeli military, this \\nindividual is a U.S. citizen and resident with no ties to the Israeli government or military.       \\nAG ¶¶ 7(a) and 7(b) are not established. \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n8 \\n \\n\\n\f",
       "Guideline C, Foreign Preference \\n \\n\\nThe security concern for foreign preference is set out in AG ¶ 9:     \\n \\nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign \\ncountry over the United States, then he or she may provide information or make \\ndecisions  that  are  harmful  to  the  interests  of  the  United  States.  Foreign \\ninvolvement  raises  concerns  about  an  individual's  judgment,  reliability,  and \\ntrustworthiness  when  it  is  in  conflict  with  U.S.  national  interests  or  when  the \\nindividual acts to conceal it. By itself; the fact that a U.S. citizen is also a citizen \\nof  another  country  is  not  disqualifying  without  an  objective  showing  of  such \\nconflict or attempt at concealment. The same is true for a U.S. citizen's exercise \\nof any right or privilege of foreign citizenship and any action to acquire or obtain \\nrecognition of a foreign citizenship. \\n \\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \\n\\nAG ¶ 10. The following is potentially applicable in this case:   \\n\\n \\n(d) participation in foreign activities, including but not limited to: \\n\\n(1) assuming or attempting to assume any type of employment, position, or  \\npolitical office in a foreign government or military organization. \\n\\nApplicant’s service in the Israeli military from November 2004 to February 2006 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nraises AG ¶ 10(d).   \\n \\n\\nConditions that could mitigate foreign preference security concerns are provided  \\n\\nunder AG ¶ 11. The following are potentially applicable: \\n \\n\\n(f)  the  foreign  preference,  if  detected,  involves  a  foreign  country,  entity,  or \\nassociation that poses a low national security risk; and \\n \\n(g) civil employment or military service was authorized under U.S. law, or  \\nthe employment or service was otherwise consented to as required by U.S. law. \\n \\n \\nAs  a  23  year  old,  Applicant  decided  that  serving  in  the  Israeli  military  would \\nenable him to further his desired career in security in support of the U.S. Government. \\nSince  his  longstanding  medical  condition,  which  he  determined  he  did  not  have  to \\ndisclose to the Israeli military, rendered him ineligible to serve in the U.S. military, he \\nviewed  his  decision  as  a  reasonable  option.  That  the  United  States  and  Israel  were \\nallies  with  mutual  adversaries  also  factored  into  his  decision.  He  has  matured  since \\nthen.  He  acknowledged  he  should  have  disclosed  his  medical  condition  to  the  Israeli \\nmilitary. His Israeli military service occurred between 11 and 13 years ago. He no longer \\nhas any ties to the Israeli government or military. He has never been an Israeli citizen, \\nhe  has  never  held  an  Israeli  passport,  and  he  has  never  held  an  Israeli  security \\nclearance. AG ¶¶ 11(f) and 11(g) are applicable. \\n  \\n\\n \\n9 \\n \\n\\n\f",
       "Whole-Person Concept \\n \\nUnder  the  whole-person  concept,  the  administrative  judge  must  evaluate  an \\n \\napplicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s \\nconduct  and  all  relevant  circumstances.

On  November  3,  2014,  the  Department  of  Defense \\nConsolidated  Adjudications  Facility  (DODCAF)  issued  Applicant  a  Statement  of \\nReasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guidelines F and E. The  action was \\ntaken  under  Executive  Order  10865,  Safeguarding  Classified  Information  Within \\nIndustry  (February  20,  1960),  as  amended;  Department  of  Defense  Directive  5220.6, \\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \\namended  (Directive);  and  the  adjudicative  guidelines  (AG)  effective  within  the \\nDepartment of Defense on September 1, 2006.  \\n\\n \\nApplicant  answered  the  SOR  in  writing  on  December  8,  2014.  Applicant \\n\\nrequested his case be decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.  \\n\\n \\nOn April 17, 2015, Department Counsel submitted the Department=s written case. \\nA complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM), consisting of Items 1 to 7, was \\n\\n \\n1 \\n \\n \\n\\n\f",

Applicant \\nreceived the FORM on September 14, 2015.  \\n\\n \\nApplicant  did  not  file  a  Response  to  the  FORM  within  the  30  day  time  allowed \\n\\nthat would have expired on October 14, 2015.  \\n\\n \\nI  received  the  case assignment on  November  5,  2015. Based  upon  a  review  of \\n\\nthe pleadings and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \\n\\n \\n\\nFindings of Fact \\n\\n \\n\\nApplicant admitted   allegations in Subparagraphs 1.a to 1.g , then fails to admit \\nor deny 1.h, and 1i., then admits and disputes 1.j to 1.m, and fails to admit or deny 1.n \\nto 1.q. in Paragraph 1 concerning financial debts. He admitted the 10 allegations under \\nParagraph  2  alleging  20  personal  conduct  security  violations.  He  further  stated  in  his \\nAnswer  that  Subparagraphs  1.d  to  1.h  were  ”investigated  by  management”  without \\ndisclosing the results of those investigations. (Items 1-7)  \\n\\n \\nApplicant  is  35  years  old,  married  having  been  previously  divorced,  and  has \\nthree children and one stepchild. He works as a security guard for a defense contractor. \\nApplicant served in the U.S. Marines from 1998 to 2002. (Items 2-4) \\n \\n \\nApplicant  owes  $129,524  for  these  17  delinquent  debts.  His  Answer  states  he \\npaid  five  debts  (Subparagraphs  1.c,  1.e,  1.h,  1.i,  1.o),  has  installment  agreements  for \\nsix other debts (Subparagraphs 1.a, 1b, 1.d, 1.g, 1.n, 1.p, and 1.q), and is disputing four \\nother  debts  (Subparagraphs  1.j  to  1.m).  The  debt  to  an  insurance  company  in \\nSubparagraph 1.f he simply admits with no other explanation. The earliest debt is dated \\nin 2004.  (Items 1-7) \\n \\n \\nApplicant’s  Personal  Financial  Statement  submitted  with  his  interrogatory \\nanswers  states  his  2004  divorce  and  physical  injury  in  2010  caused  his  financial \\ndifficulties, but they are  “turning around” now. Applicant did not submit any documents \\nto support his SOR answers that debts are paid or being paid on the installment basis. \\nHe did not submit any dispute letters on other debts. He did not respond to the FORM. \\n(Items 1-7) \\n \\n \\nApplicant has numerous violations on his work record for his employer, for whom \\nhe has worked since 2004. Applicant had non-medical call-offs between 2004 and 2013, \\ntardiness in the same time, and several counseling sessions. The counseling pertained \\nto  his  possession  of  a  personal  cell  phone  at  the  work  site,  conducting  personal \\nbusiness on a government telephone, having a beverage at the work site, failing to sign \\nin after a meal break, failure to maintain his uniform, failure to execute his duties when \\nhe did not take a key inventory, failure to sign a schedule receipt for four hours of hold \\nover work he performed, failure to park a work vehicle in the correct location for which a \\n\\n \\n\\n2 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n\f",
       "parking ticket was issued to his employer, failure to sign into work, failure to hand carry \\na  package  to  the  addressee  that  resulted  in  a  processing  delay,  and  allowing  an \\nunauthorized  vehicle  to  gain  access  to  a  facility  without  properly  obtaining  valid \\nidentification  from  the  driver  and  vehicle  inspection  in  December  2006.  Applicant \\nreceived  a  letter  of  suspension  in  May  2006.  In  October  2006  he  received  a  two  day \\nsuspension.  In  December  2006  termination  was  started,  in  September  2011  Applicant \\nwas suspended for two days after having a cell phone at the work site, and in February \\n2012  he  received  a  one  day  suspension for  being  tardy  for  work  four  times.  Applicant \\nadmitted  all  these  violations  with  the  notation  on  the  disciplinary  accusations  that \\n“management investigated” them. (Items 1-7) \\n \\n \\nApplicant’s file contains several hundred pages of documents listing his violations \\nas  alleged  in  the  SOR  and  the  disciplinary  action  taken  by  his  employer.  These \\ndocuments support each SOR allegation. (Item 4) \\n  \\n\\n     Applicant  did  not  submit  any  documentation  that  he  has  participated  in  credit \\ncounseling or budget education. He provided no evidence concerning the quality of his \\njob  performance.  He  submitted  no  character  references  or  other  evidence  tending  to \\nestablish  good  judgment,  trustworthiness,  or  reliability.  I  was  unable  to  evaluate  his \\ncredibility, demeanor, or character in person since he elected to have his case decided \\nwithout a hearing. \\n \\n\\nPolicies \\n\\n \\n\\nWhen  evaluating  an  applicant=s  suitability \\n\\nthe \\nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \\nintroductory  explanations  for  each  guideline,  the  adjudicative  guidelines  list  potentially \\ndisqualifying  conditions  and  mitigating  conditions,  which  are  useful  in  evaluating  an \\napplicant=s eligibility for access to classified information. \\n\\nfor  a  security  clearance, \\n\\n \\nThese  guidelines  are  not  inflexible  rules  of  law.  Instead,  recognizing  the \\ncomplexities  of  human  behavior,  the  administrative  judge  applies  the  guidelines  in \\nconjunction  with  the  factors  listed  in  AG  ¶  2  describing  the  adjudicative  process.  The \\nadministrative \\nimpartial,  and \\ncommonsense decision. According to AG  &amp; 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious \\nscrutiny  of  a  number  of  variables  known  as  the  Awhole-person  concept.@  The \\nadministrative  judge  must  consider  all  available,  reliable  information  about  the  person, \\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \\n\\njudge=s  overarching  adjudicative  goal \\n\\nis  a \\n\\nfair, \\n\\n \\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG &amp; 2(b) \\nrequires  that  A[a]ny  doubt  concerning  personnel  being  considered  for  access  to \\nclassified  information  will  be  resolved  in  favor  of  national  security.@  In  reaching  this \\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \\nthe evidence contained in the record.  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n3 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n\f",
       "According  to  Directive  &amp;  E3.1.14,  the  Government  must  present  evidence  to \\nestablish  controverted  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  Under  Directive  &amp;  E3.1.15,  an \\n“applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \\nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \\nand  has  the  ultimate  burden  of  persuasion  as  to  obtaining  a  favorable  clearance \\ndecision.”  \\n\\nthe  Government  predicated  upon \\n\\n \\nA  person  who  seeks  access  to  classified  information  enters  into  a  fiduciary \\nrelationship  with \\ntrust  and  confidence.  This \\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \\nGovernment  reposes  a  high  degree  of  trust  and  confidence  in  individuals  to  whom  it \\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \\nthe  possible  risk  the  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  protect  or \\nsafeguard  classified  information.  Such  decisions  entail  a  certain  degree  of  legally \\npermissible  extrapolation  as  to  potential,  rather  than  actual,  risk  of  compromise  of \\nclassified information. See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \\n \\n\\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \\n \\n\\nAnalysis \\n\\n \\n\\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \\n\\nout in AG &amp; 18:       \\n \\n\\nFailure  or  inability  to  live  within  one=s  means,  satisfy  debts,  and  meet \\nfinancial  obligations  may  indicate  poor  self-control,  lack  of  judgment,  or \\nunwillingness  to  abide  by  rules  and  regulations,  all  of  which  can  raise \\nquestions  about  an  individual=s  reliability,  trustworthiness  and  ability  to \\nprotect  classified \\nfinancially \\noverextended  is  at  risk  of  having  to  engage  in  illegal  acts  to  generate \\nfunds.  \\n\\ninformation.  An \\n\\nindividual  who \\n\\nis \\n\\n \\n\\nThe guideline at AG &amp; 19 contains nine disqualifying conditions that could raise \\nsecurity concerns. From these nine conditions, two conditions are applicable to the facts \\nfound in this case: \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and   \\n \\n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \\n \\n \\nFrom  2004  to  the  present,  Applicant  accumulated  17  delinquent  debts,  totaling \\n$129,524 that remain unpaid or unresolved. Applicant has not shown clearly what debts \\nhe paid or is paying beyond his mere statements in his Answer.

       " \\nstatus of his debts cannot be known. An in-depth review of the Items in the file shows \\nno support for his alleged payments.  \\n \\n\\nThe  guideline  in  AG  ¶  20  contains  six  conditions  that  could  mitigate  security \\nconcerns  arising  from  financial  difficulties.  Only  one  mitigating  condition  might  have \\npartial applicability. \\n\\n \\n\\n(b)  the  conditions  that  resulted  in  the  financial  problem  were  largely \\nbeyond  the  person's  control  (e.g.,  loss  of  employment,  a  business \\ndownturn,  unexpected  medical  emergency,  or  a  death,  divorce  or \\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. \\n\\n \\n\\nAG ¶ 20 (b) would apply if his divorce 11 years ago adversely affected his ability \\nto repay his debts. But he also has to act responsibly under the circumstances. It is his \\nburden  of  proof  to  submit  specific  documents  to  demonstrate  those  actions.  However, \\nhe failed to meet his burden of proof on that issue.  \\n\\n \\nLastly,  Applicant  contends  his  medical  problem  in  2010  caused  some  of  his \\ndelinquent debt. Applicant failed to prove AG ¶ 20 (b) applied because he did not submit \\nsufficient evidence of the conditions that he asserted were beyond his control and that \\nhe  acted  responsibly  in  resolving  his  delinquent  debts  during  the  time  the  debts  were \\naccumulating. \\n\\n \\n\\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \\n\\n \\nAG ¶ 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \\n \\nConduct  involving  questionable  judgment,  lack  of  candor,  dishonesty,  or \\nunwillingness  to  comply  with  rules  and  regulations  can  raise  questions \\nabout  an  individual's  reliability,  trustworthiness  and  ability  to  protect \\nclassified  information.  Of  special  interest  is  any  failure  to  provide  truthful \\nand  candid  answers  during  the  security  clearance  process  or  any  other \\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \\n \\nAG  ¶  16  describes  conditions  that  could  raise  a  security  concern  and  may  be \\n\\ndisqualifying: \\n\\n \\n (c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \\nnot  sufficient  for  an  adverse  determination  under  any  other  single \\nguideline,  but  which,  when  considered  as  a  whole,  supports  a  whole-\\nperson  assessment  of  questionable \\njudgment,  untrustworthiness, \\nunreliability,  lack  of  candor,  unwillingness  to  comply  with  rules  and \\nregulations,  or  other  characteristics  indicating  that  the  person  may  not \\nproperly safeguard protected information; \\n\\n \\n\\n5 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n\f",
       " \\n\\n(d)  credible  adverse  information  that  is  not  explicitly  covered  under  any \\nother  guideline  and  may  not  be  sufficient  by  itself  for  an  adverse \\ndetermination,  but  which,  when  combined  with  all  available  information \\nsupports  a  whole-person  assessment  of  questionable \\njudgment, \\nuntrustworthiness,  unreliability,  lack  of  candor,  unwillingness  to  comply \\nwith  rules  and  regulations,  or  other  characteristics  indicating  that  the \\nperson  may  not  properly  safeguard  protected  information.  This  includes \\nbut is not limited to consideration of: \\n \\n\\n(1)  untrustworthy  or  unreliable  behavior  to  include  breach  of  client \\nconfidentiality,  release  of  proprietary  information, unauthorized  release of \\nsensitive corporate or other government protected information: \\n \\n\\n(2)  disruptive,  violent,  or  other  inappropriate  behavior  in  the \\n\\nworkplace;  \\n \\n\\n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations;  \\n\\n \\n\\n(4)  evidence  of  significant  misuse  of  Government  or  other \\n\\nemployer's time or resources; and \\n \\n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \\nthat  creates  a  vulnerability  to  exploitation,  manipulation,  or  duress,  such \\nas  (1)  engaging  in  activities  which,  if  known,  may  affect  the  person's \\npersonal,  professional,  or  community  standing,  or  (2)  while  in  another \\ncountry,  engaging  in  any  activity  that  is  illegal  in  that  country  or  that  is \\nlegal  in  that  country  but  illegal  in  the  United  States  and  may  serve  as  a \\nbasis  for  exploitation  or  pressure  by  the  foreign  security  or  intelligence \\nservice or other group; \\n \\nApplicant  committed  numerous  acts  of  inappropriate  conduct  in  the  work  place, \\nexhibited  a pattern of dishonesty  and  rule  violations,  and  misused  his  employer’s  time \\nand resources to a significant degree, as shown by the continuing pattern of misconduct \\nfrom  2004  to  2014.  AG  ¶  16  (c)  and  (d)  apply  to  the  totality  of  Applicant’s  repeated \\nviolations and failure to conform his behavior to expected standards of conduct.  \\n\\n \\nApplicant’s  personal  conduct,  which  consists  of  a  number  repeated  and \\nsignificant  violations  of  company  policies,  creates  a  vulnerability  to  exploitation, \\nmanipulation, or duress because of the frequency and nature of the incidents. Coupled \\nwith his financial debts, Applicant is especially vulnerable to coercion and duress in the \\nhope of extricating himself from his predicament caused by his misconduct and financial \\ndelinquencies. AG ¶ 16 (e) is established.  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n6 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n\f",
       " \\n\\nAG  ¶  17  provides  seven  conditions  that  could  mitigate  security  concerns.  A \\nreview of each shows that none apply in this Applicant’s case. His offenses are a series \\nof  transgressions  that  show  an  inattention  to  the  requirements  of  his  position,  casting \\ndoubt  on  his  reliability,  trustworthiness,  and  good  judgment.  AG  ¶  17  (c)  is  not \\nestablished.  \\n \\n\\nApplicant has not acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change \\nhis actions or taken other positive steps to show his course of conduct will not recur. AG \\n¶ 17 (d) does not apply.  \\n \\n\\nApplicant  has  not  taken  positive  action  to  reduce  or  eliminate  vulnerability  to \\n\\nexploitation, manipulation, or duress. AG ¶ 17 (e) is not established.  \\n \\n\\nThe information is substantiated in many documents submitted in the Applicant’s \\n\\nfile. AG ¶ 17 (f) is not established.  \\n \\n\\nFinally, there is no allegation that Applicant associated with persons involved with \\ncriminal  activity,  so  AG  ¶17  (g)  is  not  applicable.  Nor  are  the  first  two  mitigating \\nconditions of any applicability because they apply to false statements by any Applicant \\nor failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \\n \\nWhole-Person Concept \\n\\n \\nUnder  the  whole-person  concept,  the  administrative  judge  must  evaluate  an \\napplicant=s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant=s \\nconduct  and  all  relevant  circumstances.  The  administrative  judge  should  consider  the \\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG &amp; 2(a): \\n\\nthe  nature,  extent,  and  seriousness  of \\nto \\n\\n \\nthe \\nthe  conduct;  (2) \\n(1) \\ncircumstances  surrounding \\ninclude  knowledgeable \\nparticipation;  (3)  the  frequency  and  recency  of  the  conduct;  (4)  the \\nindividual=s  age  and  maturity  at  the  time  of  the  conduct;  (5)  the extent to \\nwhich  participation \\nthe  presence  or  absence  of \\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \\nfor  the  conduct;  (8)  the  potential  for  pressure,  coercion,  exploitation,  or \\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \\n \\n\\nthe  conduct, \\n\\nis  voluntary;  (6) \\n\\nUnder AG &amp; 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \\nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.      \\n\\n \\n\\nI  considered  the  potentially  disqualifying  and  mitigating  conditions  in  light  of  all \\nfacts  and  circumstances  surrounding  this  case.  Applicant  was  an  adult  when  he \\nincurred  the  debts.  He  has  not  taken  any  action  supported  by  objective  evidence  to \\n\\n \\n\\n7 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n\f",
       " \\nresolve his delinquent debts. This inaction leaves him vulnerable to pressure, coercion, \\nexploitation,  or  duress  based  on  the  magnitude  of  his  financial  obligation.  His  lack  of \\naction continues to this day, and is obviously voluntary. His inaction will continue based \\non  his  past  performance.  Applicant  displayed  a  lack  of  good  judgment  incurring  the \\ndebts.  Next,  he  exhibited  a  continued  lack  of  appropriate  judgment  by  failing  to  make \\npayments on any of his delinquent debts during the past seven years. \\n\\n \\nApplicant also has a pattern of violations of work standards set by his employer. \\nHe is an inattentive employee who finds it difficult to conform his behavior to the rules \\nand regulations of his employer. His misconduct has been perpetrated over a decade of \\nemployment. \\n\\n \\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or substantial doubts as to \\nApplicant=s  eligibility  and  suitability  for  a  security  clearance.  For  all  these  reasons,  I \\nconclude  Applicant  did  not  mitigate  the  security  concerns  arising  under  the  guidelines \\nfor Financial Considerations and Personal Conduct.  \\n \\n\\nFormal Findings \\n\\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \\n\\n \\n \\nas required by ¶ E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \\n \\n\\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \\n\\n \\n          Subparagraph 1.a to 1.q: \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:   \\n\\nSubparagraphs 2.a to 2.j:   \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nAGAINST APPLICANT \\n\\nAgainst Applicant \\n\\nAGAINST APPLICANT \\n\\nAgainst Applicant \\n\\nConclusion \\n\\n \\n\\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \\nclearly  consistent  with  the  national  interest  to  grant  Applicant  eligibility  for  a  security \\nclearance.

DOD  CAF  acted  under  Executive \\nOrder  (EO)  10865,  Safeguarding  Classified  Information  within  Industry  (February  20, \\n1960),  as  amended;  DOD  Directive  5220.6,  Defense  Industrial  Personnel  Security \\nClearance  Review  Program  (January  2,  1992),  as  amended  (Directive);  and  the \\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on September 1, 2006. \\n\\n \\nApplicant  answered  the  SOR  on  July  14,  2015,  and  elected  to  have  his  case \\ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.

       "included in the FORM is identified as Items 4-10 and is admitted into the record (Items \\n1-3 are pleadings and transmittal documents). The FORM was mailed to Applicant, who \\nreceived it on October 19, 2015. Applicant was given an opportunity to file objections \\nand submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. He submitted an undated \\nresponse to the FORM, which was admitted without objection as Applicant Exhibit (AE) \\nA. The case was assigned to me on December 21, 2015.  \\n\\nIn Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted all but one of the allegations. The \\nadmissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a careful review of the pleadings and \\nevidence, I make the following additional findings of fact.1 \\n\\n \\nApplicant is 56 years old. He has worked for a defense contractor since 1997. He \\nis divorced and has three children, ages 15, 18, and 20. He has a bachelor’s degree. He \\nhas no military experience.2  \\n \\n \\n \\nApplicant’s conduct raised in the SOR included: a history of consuming alcohol, \\nat times, to excess from 1974 to about April 2014; being found guilty for operating under \\nthe  influence  of  alcohol  (OUI)  in  February  1991;  being  found  guilty  for  OUI  2nd  in \\nNovember 1997; and being found guilty for OUI 3rd in November 2010 (See SOR ¶¶ 1.a \\n- 1.d).3 \\n \\n \\nApplicant  began  drinking  alcohol  when  he  was  approximately  15  years  old  in \\n1974. He drinks beer on most occasions. Even after his OUI convictions, he stated he \\nwas  still  was  consuming  two  to  three  beers  a  week.  He  drinks  in  social  settings  and \\nafter hockey games. As a result of his 2010 OUI conviction, he lost his driver’s license \\nfor five years. He completed his probation in May 2015.4 \\n \\n \\nCourt documents establish that Applicant was found guilty of three OUI offenses, \\nin 1992 (1991 arrest), 2000 (1997 arrest), and 2012 (2010 arrest). He was placed on \\nprobation in each instance.5 \\n \\n \\nIn  February  1991,  Applicant  was  driving  home  from  a  friend’s  house  where  he \\nconsumed  about  four  beers.  He  was  stopped  by  a  police  officer  who  had  observed \\nApplicant’s  car  cross  over  the  center  line.  Applicant  was  given,  and  failed,  a  field \\nsobriety test. He was taken into the police station where he refused a breathalyzer test. \\n                                                           \\n1 Item 2. \\n \\n2 Item 4. \\n \\n3 Items 1, 3. \\n \\n4 Item 10; AE A. \\n \\n5 Item 7, 9; AE A. \\n \\n\\n \\n\\nFindings of Fact \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n2 \\n \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "He was charged with OUI and later pleaded guilty. He was required to attend 12 weeks \\nof alcohol education and counseling classes, which he completed.6 \\n \\n \\nIn November 1997, Applicant was going home from a high school football game \\nwhen he was stopped in traffic by a police officer. Applicant had two beers before the \\ngame  and  shared  a  flask  containing  some  kind  of  alcohol  at  the  game.  The  officer \\napparently  asked  Applicant \\nif  he  had  been  drinking  and  Applicant  answered \\naffirmatively. He was then given field sobriety tests, which he failed. He was arrested, \\ntaken back to the police station and given a breathalyzer test, which he also failed. He \\nwas  found  guilty  of  OUI  and  sentenced  to  two  years’  probation,  loss  of  his  driver’s \\nlicense  for  six  months,  and  12  weeks  required  attendance  at  alcohol  education  and \\ncounseling classes.7 \\n \\n \\nIn  November  2010,  Applicant  was  driving  back  from  a  hockey  tournament  and \\nwas stopped by a state patrolman because he crossed the center line. Applicant had \\nconsumed six beers and shared a flask of whiskey at the hockey tournament. He failed \\nthe  field  sobriety  tests  and  was  almost  incoherent  to  the  patrolman.  He  was  arrested \\nand taken to a police station where he was offered a breathalyzer test. He was unable \\nto properly perform the test, which was deemed a refusal to take the test. He was found \\nguilty of OUI and sentenced to six months’ incarceration, five years of probation, loss of \\ndriver’s  license  for  five  years,  and  mandatory  substance  abuse  evaluation  and \\ntreatment.8 \\n \\nThe court-ordered substance abuse treatment involved two mandatory sessions \\n \\nand  Applicant  voluntarily  attended  six  more  sessions.  He \\nto  provide \\ndocumentation of any evaluation done by the counselors, but Applicant stated he was \\ndiagnosed  as  being  an  alcohol  abuser.  Applicant  also  attended  Alcohol  Anonymous \\n(AA) meetings once every six to eight weeks. He last attended an AA meeting in May \\n2015. He continued to drink an occasional beer every few months. In May 2015, at an \\nAA meeting he heard a story had made him decide to stop drinking alcohol entirely. He \\nclaims he has not had any alcohol since that time.9 \\n \\n\\nfailed \\n\\nfor  a  security  clearance, \\n\\nWhen  evaluating  an  applicant’s  suitability \\n\\n \\nthe \\nadministrative  judge  must  consider  the  adjudicative  guidelines.  In  addition  to  brief \\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \\ndisqualifying  conditions  and  mitigating  conditions,  which  are  used  in  evaluating  an \\napplicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. \\n                                                           \\n6 Item 10. \\n \\n7 Item 10. \\n \\n8 Items 7, 10. \\n \\n9 Item 6-10; AE A. \\n \\n\\nPolicies \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n3 \\n \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "These  guidelines  are  not  inflexible  rules  of  law.  Instead,  recognizing  the \\ncomplexities  of  human  behavior,  these  guidelines  are  applied  in  conjunction  with  the \\nfactors  listed  in  the  adjudicative  process.  The  administrative  judge’s  overarching \\nadjudicative  goal  is  a  fair,  impartial,  and  commonsense  decision.  According  to  AG  ¶ \\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \\nthe  “whole-person  concept.”  The  administrative  judge  must  consider  all  available, \\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \\nmaking a decision. \\n\\n \\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) \\nrequires  that  “[a]ny  doubt  concerning  personnel  being  considered  for  access  to \\nclassified  information  will  be  resolved  in  favor  of  national  security.”  In  reaching  this \\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \\non the evidence contained in the record.  \\n\\n \\nUnder Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \\ncontroverted  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  Under  Directive  ¶  E3.1.15,  an  “applicant  is \\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \\nmitigate  facts  admitted  by  applicant  or  proven  by  Department  Counsel,  and  has  the \\nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.”  \\n\\nthe  Government  predicated  upon \\n\\n \\nA  person  who  seeks  access  to  classified  information  enters  into  a  fiduciary \\nrelationship  with \\ntrust  and  confidence.  This \\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \\nGovernment  reposes  a  high  degree  of  trust  and  confidence  in  individuals  to  whom  it \\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \\nthe  possible  risk  that  an  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  safeguard \\nclassified  information.  Such  decisions  entail  a  certain  degree  of  legally  permissible \\nextrapolation  about  potential,  rather  than  actual,  risk  of  compromise  of  classified \\ninformation. \\n\\n \\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of \\nthe national interest and shall  in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \\napplicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \\n\\nAnalysis \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \\n\\nAG ¶ 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption: \\n\\nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \\njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \\nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \\n\\n \\n4 \\n \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "AG  ¶  22  describes  conditions  that  could  raise  a  security  concern  and  may  be \\n\\ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \\n\\n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \\nthe  influence,  fighting,  child  or  spouse  abuse,  disturbing  the  peace,  or \\nother  incidents  of  concern,  regardless  of  whether  the  individual  is \\ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent;  \\n\\n(c)  habitual  or  binge  consumption  of  alcohol  to  the  point  of  impaired \\njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol \\nabuser or alcohol dependent. \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\nof both disqualifying conditions.  \\n\\nApplicant’s three OUI convictions and his drinking history support the application \\n\\nI  have  also  considered  all  of  the  mitigating  conditions  for  alcohol  consumption \\n\\nunder AG ¶ 23 and found the following relevant: \\n\\n(a)  so  much  time  has  passed,  or  the  behavior  was  so  infrequent,  or  it \\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \\nor good judgment; and \\n\\n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol \\nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \\nhas  established  a  pattern  of  abstinence  (if  alcohol  dependent)  or \\nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser). \\n\\n \\nApplicant’s  last  adverse  alcohol  incident  occurred  in  November  2010  and  he \\ncame  off  probation  for  that  offense  in  May  2015.  His  three  OUI  convictions  are  not \\ninfrequent  under  these  circumstances.  Insufficient  attenuation  exists  to  conclude \\nenough  time  has  passed  since  his  last  alcohol-related  incident.  His  history  of  OUI \\narrests  and  convictions  under  similar  circumstances  suggest  that  recurrence  is  a \\npossibility. His current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment are in doubt. AG ¶ \\n23(a) does not apply. \\n \\nApplicant recently decided to totally abstain from using alcohol. He indicated that \\n \\nhe has abstained since May 2015. While this is a commendable start, it is too soon to \\ndetermine whether his abstinence will continue to be part of his life or whether he will \\nuse alcohol responsibly in the future. AG ¶ 23(b) partially applies.   \\n \\nWhole-Person Concept \\n \\nUnder  the  whole-person  concept,  the  administrative  judge  must  evaluate  an \\n \\napplicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s \\n\\n \\n5 \\n \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  \\n \\n\\nthe  conduct, \\n\\nthe  nature,  extent,  and  seriousness  of \\nto \\n\\n(1) \\nthe  conduct;  (2) \\nthe \\ncircumstances  surrounding \\ninclude  knowledgeable \\nparticipation;  (3)  the  frequency  and  recency  of  the  conduct;  (4)  the \\nindividual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \\nwhich  participation \\nthe  presence  or  absence  of \\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \\nfor  the  conduct;  (8)  the  potential  for  pressure,  coercion,  exploitation,  or \\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \\n \\n\\nis  voluntary;  (6) \\n\\nUnder AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \\nof the guideline and the whole-person concept.        \\n\\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered the circumstances that \\nled  to  his  arrests  and  his  current  state  of  abstinence.  Overall,  the  record  evidence \\nleaves  me  with  questions  and  doubts  as  to  Applicant’s  eligibility  and  suitability  for  a \\nsecurity  clearance.  For  all  these  reasons,  I  conclude  Applicant  failed  to  mitigate  the \\nsecurity concerns under Guideline G. \\n\\nFormal Findings \\n\\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \\n\\n \\n \\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \\n \\n \\n \\n\\nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.d: \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nAgainst Applicant \\n\\nAGAINST APPLICANT \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nConclusion \\n\\n \\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \\nclearly  consistent  with  the  national  interest  to  grant  Applicant  eligibility  for  a  security \\nclearance.

Zaid, Esq. \\n\\nLOUGHRAN, Edward W., Administrative Judge: \\n\\n \\nApplicant  mitigated  the  financial  considerations  security  concerns.  Eligibility  for \\n\\naccess to classified information is granted.  \\n \\n\\nStatement of the Case \\n\\nOn October 28, 2014, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \\nReasons  (SOR)  to  Applicant  detailing  security  concerns  under  Guideline  F,  financial \\nconsiderations. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \\n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \\n1992),  as  amended  (Directive);  and  the  adjudicative  guidelines  (AG)  implemented  by \\nthe DOD on September 1, 2006. \\n\\n \\nApplicant  responded  to  the  SOR  on  November  14,  2014,  and  requested  a \\nhearing  before  an  administrative  judge.  The  case  was  originally  assigned  to  me  on \\nFebruary 27, 2015. Scheduling of the case was delayed because Applicant was working \\noverseas. The case was reassigned to me on May 4, 2015. After coordinating with the \\nparties, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n1 \\n\\n\n",
       "on  July  16,  2015,  scheduling  the  hearing  for  August  18,  2015.  The  hearing  was \\nconvened  as  scheduled.  DOHA  received  the  hearing  transcript  (Tr.)  on  August  26, \\n2015.  \\n \\n\\nEvidentiary Rulings \\n\\nGovernment  Exhibits  (GE)  1,  2,  4,  5,  and  6  were  admitted  in  evidence  without \\nobjection. GE 3 was admitted over Applicant’s objection. Applicant testified, called five \\nwitnesses, and submitted Applicant’s Exhibits (AE) A through Z, which were admitted \\nwithout  objection.  The  record  was  held  open  for  Applicant  to  submit  additional \\ninformation. He submitted documents that I have marked AE AA and BB1 and admitted \\nwithout objection.  \\n \\n\\nFindings of Fact \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\nApplicant is a 57-year-old self-employed contractor for a defense contractor. He \\nserved  in  the  U.S.  military  from  1979  until  he  retired  in  2000.  He  seeks  to  retain  a \\nsecurity clearance, which he has held since he was in the military. He attended college \\nfor a period, but he is a few credits shy of a degree. His first marriage ended in divorce. \\nHe has been married to his current spouse for more than 25 years. He has two adult \\nchildren.2 \\n \\n \\nApplicant spent the majority of his military career in special operations. He went \\non  numerous  combat  missions,  conducted  clandestine  insertions,  and  operated \\nundercover.  When  he  retired  he  became  an  entrepreneur  and  started  his  own \\ncompanies.  His  primary  company  was  incorporated,  but  Applicant  had  to  personally \\nguarantee many of the company’s liabilities. He also invested in real estate. His primary \\ncompany  suffered  significant  setbacks  during  the  recession  and  housing  crisis  of  the \\nlater part of the 2000s. His real estate properties lost much of their value.

He credibly testified that it will \\ntake time, but he is committed to resolving all his debts.14  \\n \\n \\nApplicant’s character evidence was extraordinary.

In  addition  to  brief \\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \\ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \\napplicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. \\n \\n\\nfor  a  security  clearance, \\n\\nThese  guidelines  are  not  inflexible  rules  of  law.  Instead,  recognizing  the \\ncomplexities  of  human  behavior,  administrative  judges  apply  the  guidelines  in \\nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s \\noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \\nto  AG  ¶  2(c),  the  entire  process  is  a  conscientious  scrutiny  of  a  number  of  variables \\nknown  as  the  “whole-person  concept.”  The  administrative  judge  must  consider  all \\navailable,  reliable  information  about  the  person,  past  and  present,  favorable  and \\nunfavorable, in making a decision. \\n\\n \\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) \\nrequires  that  “[a]ny  doubt  concerning  personnel  being  considered  for  access  to \\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.”  \\n\\n \\nUnder Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \\ncontroverted  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  Under  Directive  ¶  E3.1.15,  the  applicant  is \\nresponsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \\nor  mitigate  facts  admitted  by  the  applicant  or  proven  by  Department  Counsel.”  The \\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \\n\\nthe  Government  predicated  upon \\n\\n \\nA  person  who  seeks  access  to  classified  information  enters  into  a  fiduciary \\n \\nrelationship  with \\ntrust  and  confidence.  This \\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \\nGovernment  reposes  a  high  degree  of  trust  and  confidence  in  individuals  to  whom  it \\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \\nthe  possible  risk  the  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  safeguard \\nclassified  information.  Such  decisions  entail  a  certain  degree  of  legally  permissible \\n                                                           \\n14 Tr. at 50, 180-181, 190-193, 197; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 3 ; AE A, U, W, Y. \\n \\n15 Tr. at 25-28, 50-51, 62-74; AE B-L, T. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n5 \\n\\n\n",

The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \\n\\n \\n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \\n\\n \\n\\n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\nevidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions.  \\n \\n  \\nprovided under AG ¶ 20.

Additionally, the SOR alleged the high credit on the two \\nmortgage  loans  (SOR  ¶¶  1.d  -  $351,562  and  1.e  -  $271,900),  when  the  balances  on \\nthose loans were reported as zero.  \\n \\n  \\nApplicant paid his 2008 federal income taxes. He has a payment plan in place for \\nhis  2012  and  2013  tax  years.  He  settled  and  paid  the  second  mortgage  loan  on  his \\nhome,  and  he  paid  other  debts  that  were  not  alleged  in  the  SOR.  His  attorney  is \\nnegotiating  settlements  for  the  two  judgments  against  him.  Applicant  credibly  testified \\nthat it will take time, but he is committed to resolving all his debts. \\n \\n \\nI find that Applicant established a plan to resolve his financial problems, and he \\ntook significant action to implement that plan. He acted responsibly and made a good-\\nfaith effort to pay his debts. There are clear indications that his financial problems are \\nbeing  resolved  and  are  under  control.  They  occurred  under  circumstances  that  are \\nunlikely  to  recur  and  do  not  cast  doubt  on  his  current  reliability,  trustworthiness,  and \\ngood judgment. AG ¶¶ 20(c) and 20(d) are applicable. AG ¶ 20(b) is partially applicable. \\nAG ¶ 20(a) is not yet completely applicable because Applicant is still in the process of \\npaying his debts.  \\n \\nWhole-Person Concept \\n \\nUnder  the  whole-person  concept,  the  administrative  judge  must  evaluate  an \\n \\napplicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s \\nconduct  and  all  relevant  circumstances.  The  administrative  judge  should  consider  the \\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nthe  conduct, \\n\\nthe  nature,  extent,  and  seriousness  of \\nto \\n\\nthe  conduct;  (2) \\nthe \\n(1) \\ncircumstances  surrounding \\ninclude  knowledgeable \\nparticipation;  (3)  the  frequency  and  recency  of  the  conduct;  (4)  the \\nindividual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \\nwhich  participation \\nthe  presence  or  absence  of \\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \\nfor  the  conduct;  (8)  the  potential  for  pressure,  coercion,  exploitation,  or \\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \\n\\nis  voluntary;  (6) \\n\\n \\n7 \\n\\n\n",
       " \\nUnder AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \\nsecurity  clearance  must  be  an  overall  commonsense  judgment  based  upon  careful \\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \\n \\n\\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions  in  light  of  all \\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.

Applicant had no objection to the motion.

Applicant had no \\nobjection to the amendment. The motion to amend was granted.2 \\n \\n\\nFindings of Fact \\n\\n \\n \\nApplicant is a 40-year-old mechanic who works as a quality assurance inspector \\nfor  a  defense  contractor.  He  has  been  working  for  that  contractor  in  the  Middle  East \\nsince May 2011 and has worked overseas for other defense contractors for a number of \\nyears.  He  earned  a  general  educational  development  certificate  in  1996  and  an \\nassociate’s degree in 2003. He has been married twice. He married his current wife in \\n2005. He has three children, ages 15, 16, and 22.3 \\n \\n\\nExcluding  the  withdrawn  allegations,  the  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  had  three \\ndelinquent  debts  totaling  $64,168  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.c).  In  his  Answer  to  the  SOR,  he \\ndenied each debt. Substantial evidence of the alleged debts is contained in GE 1-4.4  \\n\\n \\nIn 1999, Applicant was involved in a car accident and incurred a broken pelvis \\nand hip. He was determined to be fully disabled and collected about $1,000 per month \\nin disability payments from the Social Security Administration (SSA). While receiving the \\ndisability benefits, he knew there was a limit on how much income he could earn, but \\ndid not know the exact restrictions. In 2006, he received a letter from SSA that indicated \\n                                                           \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n1 Tr. 23-25.  \\n\\n2 Tr. 43-44.  \\n\\n3 Tr. 5-7, 23, 37-39, 42-43; GE 1. \\n\\n4 GE 1-4; Applicant’s Answer to the SOR.  \\n\\n \\n2 \\n \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "he was earning more income than he was allowed. At that time, his disability payments \\nstopped, and he has not received any further disability payments since then.5 \\n\\n \\nA credit report dated June 12, 2010, reflected that Applicant’s SSA account had \\nbeen  placed  for  collection  in  the  amount  of  $20,955  (SOR  ¶  1.c).  This  delinquent \\naccount was the result of his overpayment of disability payments. In 2008, he started \\nrepaying this debt through a monthly pay allotment of $300. When he left his job later \\nthat year, the allotment stopped. In 2012, the SSA began garnishing his pay at a rate of \\n$600 every two weeks. By early 2014 (well before the issuance of the SOR), he fully \\nrepaid this debt. In July 2014, he received a letter from the SSA stating he overpaid the \\ndebt and would be receiving a refund of $2,535.6 \\n\\n \\nIn 2008 and 2009, Applicant worked overseas, and a portion of his income was \\nexempt from taxation. In those years, his income was greater than the exemption, and \\nhe incurred taxes that he could not pay. In his security clearance application (SCA), he \\ndisclosed that he owed approximately $36,000 to the IRS for 2008 and 2009 (SOR ¶ \\n1.b). In 2010, his state also filed a $7,213 tax lien against him (SOR ¶ 1.a).7 \\n\\n \\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant stated that the state tax lien had been repaid \\nthrough monthly payroll deductions. He also stated that he had a repayment plan with \\nthe IRS and the payments are automatically deducted from his pay.8  \\n\\n  \\nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that the state tax lien was repaid, but he had \\nnot  yet  received  a  document  from  the  state  showing  it  was  paid.  He  stated  that  the \\ndeductions from his pay for the state tax lien stopped over a year ago. At the hearing, \\nhe also provided IRS account transcripts for 2008 and 2009 that showed he had been \\nconsistently  making  monthly  payments  of  $375  since  August  2012.  As  of  September \\n2015,  his  IRS  account  balance  for  2008  was  $3,961  and  for  2009  was  $17,124.  The \\naccount transcripts showed that his IRS debt had been cut almost in half.9 \\n\\n  \\nBesides the debts alleged in the SOR, Applicant’s credit report dated March 26, \\n2015, reflected that he had no other delinquent debts. He also testified that he had no \\nother delinquent debts. In 2014, he earned about $108,000 and his wife earned about \\n$25,000. In his post-hearing submission, Applicant presented letters from the state that \\nreflected he did not have an outstanding tax liability for 2008 and 2009.10 \\n\\n                                                           \\n\\n5 Tr. 26-29; GE 1. \\n \\n6 Tr. 29-32; GE 1-3; AE C. \\n \\n7 Tr. 32-36; GE 1.    \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n8 Applicant’s Answer to the SOR. \\n\\n9 Tr. 32-36, 46-51; AE D-F. \\n\\n10 Tr. 39-42; AE A, B, H, I; Applicant’s Answer to the SOR. \\n\\n \\n3 \\n \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "Policies \\n\\n \\n\\nThe  President  of  the  United  States  has  the  authority  to  control  access  to \\ninformation  bearing  on  national  security  and  to  determine  whether  an  individual  is \\nsufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. Department of the Navy v. \\nEgan,  484  U.S.  518,  527  (1988).  The  President  has  authorized  the  Secretary  of \\nDefense to grant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it \\nis clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \\nClassified  Information  within  Industry  §  2  (Feb.  20,  1960),  as  amended.  The  U.S. \\nSupreme  Court  has  recognized  the  substantial  discretion  of  the  Executive  Branch  in \\nregulating  access  to  information  pertaining  to  national  security,  emphasizing  that  “no \\none  has  a  ‘right’  to  a  security  clearance.”  Department  of  the  Navy  v.  Egan,  484  U.S. \\n518, 528 (1988). \\n\\n \\nEligibility  for  a  security  clearance  is  predicated  upon  the  applicant  meeting  the \\ncriteria  contained  in  the  adjudicative  guidelines.  These  AGs  are  not  inflexible  rules  of \\nlaw.  Instead,  recognizing  the  complexities  of  human  behavior,  these  guidelines  are \\napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s \\nadjudicative  goal  is  a  fair,  impartial,  and  commonsense  decision.  An  administrative \\njudge  must  consider  all  available,  reliable  information  about  the  person,  past  and \\npresent, favorable and unfavorable, in reaching a decision.  \\n\\n \\nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \\naccess  to  classified  information.  This  relationship  transcends  normal  duty  hours  and \\nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \\npossible  risk  that  the  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  safeguard \\nclassified  information.  Such  decisions  entail  a  certain  degree  of  legally  permissible \\nextrapolation  of  potential,  rather  than  actual,  risk  of  compromise  of  classified \\ninformation. Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in \\nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. \\nOr.  10865  §  7.  See  also  Executive  Order  12968  (Aug.  2,  1995),  Section  3.  Thus,  a \\nclearance  decision  is  merely  an  indication  that  the  Applicant  has  or  has  not  met  the \\nstrict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing \\na clearance. \\n\\n \\nInitially,  the  Government  must  establish,  by  substantial  evidence,  conditions  in \\nthe  personal  or  professional  history  of  the  applicant  that  may  disqualify  the  applicant \\nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \\nof  establishing  controverted  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  See  Egan,  484  U.S.  at  531.  \\n“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. \\nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \\npresume  a  nexus  or  rational  connection  between  proven  conduct  under  any  of  the \\ncriteria listed and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \\n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n4 \\n \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "Once  the  Government  establishes  a  disqualifying  condition  by  substantial \\nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \\nfacts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \\nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue [his or her] security \\nclearance.”  ISCR  Case  No.  01-20700  at  3  (App.  Bd.  Dec.  19,  2002).  The  burden  of \\ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. \\n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \\nif they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   \\n\\nAnalysis \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \\n\\n \\nThe security concern for this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 18 as follows: \\n\\n \\n\\nFailure  or  inability  to  live  within  one’s  means,  satisfy  debts,  and  meet \\nfinancial  obligations  may  indicate  poor  self-control,  lack  of  judgment,  or \\nunwillingness  to  abide  by  rules  and  regulations,  all  of  which  can  raise \\nquestions  about  an  individual’s  reliability,  trustworthiness  and  ability  to \\nprotect  classified \\nfinancially \\noverextended  is  at  risk  of  having  to  engage  in  illegal  acts  to  generate \\nfunds.  \\n \\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \\n\\ninformation.  An \\n\\nindividual  who \\n\\nis \\n\\nAG ¶ 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \\n\\n \\n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and  \\n\\n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nThe  evidence  established  that  Applicant  accumulated  delinquent  debts  that  he \\nwas unable or unwilling to pay for an extended period. AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) apply in \\nthis case. \\n \\n \\napplicable:  \\n \\n\\nFour financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially \\n\\n(a)  the  behavior  happened  so  long  ago,  was  so  infrequent,  or  occurred \\nunder  such  circumstances  that  it  is  unlikely  to  recur  and  does  not  cast \\ndoubt  on  the  individual’s  current  reliability,  trustworthiness,  or  good \\njudgment; \\n \\n(b)  the  conditions  that  resulted  in  the  financial  problem  were  largely \\nbeyond  the  person’s  control  (e.g.,  loss  of  employment,  a  business \\ndownturn,  unexpected  medical  emergency,  or  a  death,  divorce  or \\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \\n\\n \\n5 \\n \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "(c)  the  person  has  received  or  is  receiving  counseling  for  the  problem \\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \\nunder control; and \\n \\n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \\notherwise resolve debts.  \\n \\nApplicant  incurred  delinquent  debts  because  he  continued  to  receive  disability \\nbenefits  after  his  income  exceeded  earning  limitations  and  because  he  failed  to  pay \\ntaxes  on  income  earned  in  2008  and  2009.  These  events  do  not  constitute \\ncircumstances beyond his control. AG ¶ 20(b) does not apply. \\n\\n \\nApplicant  has  resolved  the  state  tax  lien  in  SOR  ¶  1.a  and  the  disability \\noverpayment  in  SOR  ¶  1.c.  He  has  established  a  repayment  plan  to  resolve  the \\ndelinquent  federal  taxes  in  SOR  ¶  1.b.  He  has  been  consistently  making  payments \\nunder  that  plan  for  the  past  three  years.  The  record  established  that  his  financial \\nproblems  are  under  control  and  are  being  resolved.  He  has  not  incurred  any  recent \\ndelinquent debts. His financial problems are unlikely to recur and do not cast doubt on \\nhis current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(c), and 20(d) \\napply. \\n\\n \\n\\nWhole-Person Concept \\n\\nIn  the  adjudication  process,  an  administrative  judge  must  carefully  weigh  a \\nnumber  of  variables  known  as  the  whole-person  concept.  Available  information  about \\nthe applicant as well as the factors listed in AG ¶ 2(a) should be considered in reaching \\na  determination.11  In  this  case,  I  gave  due  consideration  to  the  information  about \\nApplicant in the record and concluded the favorable information, including the mitigating \\nevidence,  outweigh  the  security  concerns  at  issue.  Applicant  met  his  burden  of \\npersuasion to mitigate the security concerns.  \\n\\nFormal findings as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive \\n\\nare:          \\n\\nFormal Findings \\n\\n \\n\\n                                                           \\n\\n11 The adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a) are as follows:  \\n\\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the \\nconduct,  to  include  knowledgeable  participation;  (3)  the  frequency  and  recency  of  the \\nconduct;  (4)  the  individual’s  age  and  maturity  at  the  time  of  the  conduct;  (5)  the  extent  to \\nwhich  participation  is  voluntary;  (6)  the  presence  or  absence  of  rehabilitation  and  other \\npermanent  behavioral  changes;  (7)  the  motivation  for  the  conduct;  (8)  the  potential  for \\npressure,  coercion,  exploitation,  or  duress;  and  (9)  the  likelihood  of  continuation  or \\nrecurrence. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n6 \\n \\n \\n\\n\n",

All  allegations  relate  to  his  handling  of  confidential  data  in  December  2007 \\nand January 2008 and his participation in the follow-up investigation in 2009 and 2010. \\nApplicant was assured that “trusted downloads” provided by the Navy and Company L \\ndid not contain classified information, when two of them contained a mix of unclassified \\nand  classified  information.  Applicant  and  his  team  members  transferred  the  trusted \\ndownloads onto computers that were for unclassified use only. There was no evidence \\nthat any of the classified information was viewed by anyone not authorized to view it. \\nApplicant made some judgment errors in his reaction to the discovery of the classified \\ninformation. In March 2008, Applicant’s attorney offered to provide requested materials \\nto the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI); Applicant cooperated with the investigation; \\nand  Applicant’s  errors  in  judgment  are  not  recent.  He  credibly  assured  conscientious \\ncompliance with security rules. He presented a strong case of whole-person mitigation. \\nSecurity concerns are mitigated. Access to classified information is granted.      \\n  \\n\\nHistory of the Case \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nOn  February  11,  2011,  Applicant  completed  and  signed  an  Electronic \\nQuestionnaires  for  Investigations  Processing  (e-QIP)  (SF  86).  (Government  Exhibit \\n(GE)  1)  On  August  18,  2014,  the  Department  of  Defense  (DOD)  Consolidated \\nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued an SOR to Applicant pursuant to Executive Order \\n\\n \\n1 \\n                                         \\n \\n\\n\n",

(Hearing  Exhibit  (HE)  2)  Specifically,  the  SOR  set  forth  security \\nconcerns arising under Guidelines K and E.   \\n\\n  \\nOn  September  2,  2014,  Applicant  responded  to  the  SOR,  and  he  requested  a \\nhearing.  On  July  23,  2015,  Department  Counsel  was  ready  to  proceed.  On  July  30, \\n2015,  the  case  was  assigned  to  me.  On  November  12,  2015,  the  Defense  Office  of \\nHearings  and  Appeals  (DOHA)  issued  a  notice  of  hearing,  setting  the  hearing  for \\nDecember 14, 2015. (HE 1) The hearing was held as scheduled. On December 7, 2015, \\nDepartment  Counsel  moved  to  amend  the  allegation  in  SOR  ¶  1.b.  There  was  no \\nobjection,  and  I  granted  the  motion.  During  the  hearing,  Department  Counsel  offered \\nseven  exhibits,  which  were  admitted  into  evidence  without  objection,  and  Applicant \\noffered  18  exhibits,  which  were  admitted  without  objection.  (Transcript  (Tr.)  17-21; \\nGovernment  Exhibit  (GE)  1-7;  Applicant  Exhibit  (AE)  A-R)  On  December  22,  2015,  I \\nreceived a transcript of the hearing.   \\n\\n  \\n\\nFindings of Fact \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nIn  Applicant’s  SOR  response,  he  denied  all  of  the  SOR  allegations.  Applicant \\nadmitted the information in amended SOR ¶ 1.b. Applicant’s admissions are accepted \\nas findings of fact.  \\n \\n\\nApplicant is a 56-year-old software engineer employed by Company D, a defense \\ncontractor from 1980 to 2007. (Tr. 179, 214; AE A) From 2008 to present, he has been \\nemployed by another defense contractor. (AE A) In January 2011, Applicant’s security \\nclearance was suspended. (GE 2; AE E)  \\n\\n \\nIn 1998, Applicant married. (Tr. 235) His spouse is a missile engineer, and she \\nhas a security clearance. (Tr. 216) He has two daughters who are 14 and 15. (Tr. 215) \\nHis  father  was  a  career  Navy  officer.  (Tr.  215)  His  two  older  brothers  served  in  the \\nNavy. (Tr. 215) His nephew was a Navy Seal, who served three tours in Afghanistan. \\n(Tr. 215) Applicant never served in the military. (Tr. 235) \\n\\n \\nCompany D funded Applicant’s college tuition, and in 1982, Applicant received a \\nbachelor  of  science  degree  in  mathematics.  (Tr.  178-179,  235;  AE  A)  After  1982, \\nApplicant worked on a variety of Navy contracts for Company D.  Sometimes he was \\nemployed at Company D, but detailed to work on Company L managed projects. (Tr. \\n180) During Desert Shield, he was deployed for six months to the Persian Gulf aboard a \\nU.S. Navy vessel. (Tr. 180) \\n\\n \\n2 \\n                                         \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "In 1999, Applicant was one of the architects of a program for a simulation test of \\npart of a weapons system developed by Company L by utilizing unclassified data. (Tr. \\n184;  GE  5;  GE  6)  From  1999  to  2007,  Applicant  was  instrumental  in  the  program \\ndevelopment. (Tr. 184-189). In November 2007, Applicant went to the Pentagon, and in \\nthe  presence  of  an  admiral,  was  shown  some  design  charts,  which  Applicant  had \\ndeveloped on behalf of Company D, and Company L had previously presented without \\nauthorization to the Navy. (Tr. 189) Applicant believed the information was improperly \\ntaken from Company D by Company L.  \\n\\n \\n\\nHandling Protected Information and Personal Conduct1  \\n\\n \\nApplicant was the leader of a team of technicians working on a Navy project. (Tr. \\n99; GE 5 at 1-2) On about 75 occasions over several years, Company L employees or \\nNavy personnel provided “trusted downloads” on flash drives or compact discs, which \\nwere supposed to be unclassified data or software that Applicant and his team could \\nuse  for  analysis.  (Tr.  94,  99-103;  GE  6  at  7)  Technicians  were  concerned  that  a  file \\nmarked  unclassified  might  actually  contain  classified  data.  (Tr.  87)  The  only  way \\nclassified information could be placed on unclassified computers was through an error \\nin  the  trusted-download  process,  or  a  deliberate  improper  transfer  of  classified \\ninformation. (Tr. 78) Applicant was not authorized to make a trusted download, and he \\ndenied knowingly transferring classified information to an unclassified computer. (Tr. 78)  \\nThere are eight or nine people that could have been responsible for entering data that \\nwas too close to the thresholds to be unclassified. (Tr. 214) \\n\\n \\nApplicant’s team’s project utilized a classified version and an unclassified version \\nof a computer program. The classified version used “a set of parameters, thresholds, \\nwhich [were] put together along with the executable part of the program” to generate a \\n“classified  result.”  (Tr.  100,  107)  The  classified  numbers  changed  as  the  project \\nadvanced.  (Tr.  122-123)  M  was  a  key  person  in  deciding  whether  data  should  be \\nclassified or not. (Tr. 128) The unclassified version of the program used numbers that \\nwere not representative of the real system to simulate interactions, which allowed use of \\nlaptops and communications in an unclassified environment and improved productivity. \\n(Tr. 100-101, 107) The non-representative numbers were used “to test the mechanics of \\nthe  program”  and  debug  problems  in  an  unclassified  environment.  (Tr.  108)  The \\nclassified numbers were not supposed to be used on unclassified computers. (Tr. 112) \\nM assumed the computer he was issued was from Company L and not from DOD. (Tr. \\n113) The unclassified versions could be used at home. (Tr. 100-102) Employees were \\nallowed to use company-issued computers for some personal use; however, extensive \\npersonal use was discouraged. (Tr. 124) At Company L, if a spillage was discovered, \\nCompany L’s facility security officer (FSO) was supposed to be notified. (Tr. 115) The \\nFSO was responsible for ensuring the file was deleted from computers. (Tr. 116) After \\ndeletion of the file, security used a cleaning program to scramble the computer memory. \\n\\n                                            \\n\\n1Unless stated otherwise, the source for the information in this section is a December 16, 2010, \\nletter from an FBI special agent written to the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) about \\nthe investigation of Applicant for unauthorized removal and retention of classified documents or material \\nin possible violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1924. (GE 3)   \\n\\n \\n3 \\n                                         \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "(Tr.  116)  Applicant  had  access  to  classified  versions  of  the  program  and  classified \\nprogram data. (Tr. 118) \\n\\n \\nEmployees  of  Companies  D  and  L  sought  to  maintain  separation  between  the \\nclassified  and  unclassified  versions.  (Tr.  101,  106-108)  In  2008,  the  security  people \\ninterviewed employees and borrowed computers with the programs on their computers \\nto check for a data spill. (Tr. 102) Security found files containing classified information \\non the computers of four to seven employees of Company L, including on M’s computer. \\n(Tr.  102-103,  118-121)  Security  performed  cleansing  operations  on  the  computers  to \\neliminate  the  files  with  classified  information.  (Tr.  102-103,  118-121)  Because  of  the \\nspillage,  the  whole  unclassified-simulation  program  was  terminated,  and  all  future \\nsimulation work was done on the classified side. (Tr. 119, 124) Team members worked \\non  different  areas  of  the  program.  (Tr.  104-105)  Their  work  would  be  subsequently \\nmerged,  which  could  cause  classified  data  to  be  unknowingly  transferred  from  one \\ncomputer to another, and no one would know the origin of the classified information. (Tr. \\n104-105)      \\n\\n \\n4 \\n                                         \\n \\n\\n \\nIn December 2007, Applicant received a trusted download onto a flash drive from \\nthe  Navy  for  evaluation  of  Applicant  and  his  team.  (Tr.  221;  GE  5;  GE  6)  The \\ninformation was supposed to unclassified. Classified files from downloads were labeled \\nwith a C, and unclassified files from trusted downloads were labeled with a T for test. \\n(Tr. 192) In December 2007, B, a GS-13, who was the senior Navy employee on the \\nteam,  was  at  Applicant’s  residence,  when  they  were  doing  some computer  work.  (Tr. \\n92, 192) Applicant inserted a flash drive into B’s laptop computer and was surprised to \\nsee a file starting with a C, which meant the file could be classified.

(GE 4) \\n\\n \\nOn  January  28,  2008,  Company  D’s  FSO  called  Applicant  and  asked  him  to \\nprovide his two DOD-issued laptop computers to Company L. (Tr. 196, 229) One of the \\nrequested laptop computers was at Applicant’s home. (Tr. 197-199) The FSO did not \\nexplain why the computers were requested. (Tr. 199) Applicant said he would bring the \\ncomputers the next day, and the FSO did not insist or demand that Applicant provide \\nthe computer sooner. (GE 6 at 6) Applicant did not believe there had been classified \\ninformation on the laptop computers.

Two  subject  matter  experts  (SMEs),  who  were \\nassociated with Applicant’s team, reviewed the “unclassified data” on the hard drive and \\ndetermined  that  there was  probably  classified  data  on  the  computer.  (Tr.  76-77,  205, \\n213;  GE  6  at  2-3)  Most  of  the  information  was  unclassified;  however,  the  classified \\ninformation  was  one  table  of  numbers  or  parameters,  and  none  of  the  SMEs  were \\naware  of  how  the  classified  table  had  migrated  from  the  classified  system  to  the \\nunclassified  system.  (Tr.  77,  88,  90,  213,  232-233)  In  February  2008,  Applicant \\ncontacted Company D’s FSO and advised her of the possibility of confidential data on \\nteam computers. The computers were collected to detect any spillage. (Tr. 205-206; GE \\n6 at 4) One of the SMEs also contacted his FSO about the possible spillage. (Tr. 206)   \\n\\n \\nApplicant  consulted  a  Navy  captain,  who  advised  Applicant  to  seek  the \\nassistance of counsel, and in February 2008, he hired a counsel with significant national \\nsecurity  experience.  (Tr.  203;  GE  5  at  2;  GE  6  at  4;  AE  M)  On  March  4,  2008, \\nApplicant’s  counsel  disclosed  to  the  FBI  that  Applicant  deleted  the  Company  D \\nproprietary files because Company L had requested the computers.

NCIS  requested  the  two  computers  in  February \\n2008. (Tr. 141; AE B) Applicant had saved tax returns and other personal information on \\nthe  desktop  computer.  The  desk  top  computer  was  obsolete  and  lacked  sufficient \\ncomputer  power  to  run  simulations,  and  Applicant  believed  it  had  no  risk  of  having \\nclassified data on it. (Tr. 210) Applicant’s attorney wanted to find out whether the two \\ncomputers were owned by Applicant, Company D, or DOD before providing them to the \\nFBI  or  NCIS.  (Tr.  141)  With  the  assistance  of  Company  D,  Applicant’s  attorney \\ndetermined  the  two  computers  were  probably  owned  by  DOD.

(Tr. 228-230) Applicant deleted the Company D proprietary information.

(Tr. \\n156-159,  210,  212)  The  discs  were  marked  unclassified.

(Tr.  150;  AE  C)  The  forensic  examination  determined  that  classified \\nmaterials had been stored on one of the laptop computers. FBI SMEs, who were not \\nrelated to Applicant’s team, reviewed the “classified values” and concluded 11 values \\nwere not sufficiently scrambled to render them unclassified. (Tr. 213; GE 3; GE 5 at 3; \\nAE P) The classification level was deemed to be confidential. (AE L; AE P) Applicant \\nbelieved the FBI SMEs erred in the manner that some of the numbers were “reverse \\nengineered”  and  classified  as  confidential  or  secret.  (GE  6  at  5)  The  FBI  had  been \\nrelying  on  erroneous  information  from  SMEs,  and  the  FBI  SMEs  had  mistakenly \\nconfused some of the unclassified testing numbers with classified data. (Tr. 151, 154, \\n211; GE 3) Applicant agreed with the FBI that one table contained classified numbers. \\n(Tr.  151-154;  GE  5  at  2-3)  Applicant  conceded  his  unclassified  computer  should  not \\nhave  been  used  for  classified  information  because  it  did  not  contain  the  security \\nmeasures required for storage of classified material. (Tr. 155-156)  \\n\\n \\nThe AUSA appeared to accept that Applicant was involved in an inadvertent spill \\nof  classified  numbers  as  opposed  to  a  deliberate  attempt  to  compromise  classified \\ninformation.

As  Commander  in  Chief,  the  President  has  the \\nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \\nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. \\nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \\napplicant’s  eligibility  for  access  to  classified  information  “only  upon  a  finding  that  it  is \\nclearly  consistent  with  the  national  interest  to  do  so.”  Exec.  Or.  10865,  Safeguarding \\nClassified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  \\n \\n\\nEligibility  for  a  security  clearance  is  predicated  upon  the  applicant  meeting  the \\ncriteria  contained  in  the  revised  adjudicative  guidelines.  These  guidelines  are  not \\ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \\nguidelines  are  applied  in  conjunction  with  an  evaluation  of  the  whole  person.  An \\nadministrative \\nimpartial,  and \\ncommonsense  decision.  An  administrative  judge  must  consider  all  available,  reliable \\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \\n\\njudge’s  overarching  adjudicative  goal \\n\\n  \\nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \\naccess  to  classified  information.  This  relationship  transcends  normal  duty  hours  and \\nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \\npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \\nabout  potential,  rather  than  actual,  risk  of  compromise  of  classified  information. \\nClearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \\n\\nis  a \\n\\nfair, \\n\\n \\n8 \\n                                         \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. \\nThis decision is not based, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination \\nabout applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. Thus, any decision to deny a security \\nclearance  is  merely  an  indication  the  applicant  has  not  met  the  strict  guidelines  the \\nPresident and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  \\n\\n \\n \\nInitially,  the  Government  must  establish,  by  substantial  evidence,  conditions  in \\nthe  personal  or  professional  history  of  the  applicant  that  may  disqualify  the  applicant \\nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \\nof  establishing  controverted  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR.

The guidelines \\npresume  a  nexus  or  rational  connection  between  proven  conduct  under  any  of  the \\ncriteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \\nat 2 (App. Bd.

Sept. 24, 2013).  \\n\\n \\nThree mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 17 are potentially applicable:  \\n \\n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \\nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \\nunlikely  to  recur  and  does  not  cast  doubt  on  the  individual's  reliability, \\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \\n \\n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \\nto  change  the  behavior  or  taken  other  positive  steps  to  alleviate  the \\nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \\nor  other  inappropriate  behavior,  and  such  behavior  is  unlikely  to  recur;  \\nand \\n \\n(e)  the  individual  has  taken  positive  steps  to  reduce  or  eliminate \\nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \\n \\nAG ¶ 16(e) is mitigated by AG ¶ 17(e) because Applicant has fully disclosed his \\nrule violations. Law enforcement, security officials, and his witnesses are well aware of \\nhis  security-related  conduct,  and he  is not  vulnerable  to  exploitation, manipulation,  or \\nduress because of his security-related conduct. \\n\\n \\nAG ¶¶ 17(c) and 17(d) apply. The only evidence of Applicant’s December 2007 \\nsecurity breach was Applicant’s self-report; however, his self-report was not timely, as it \\nappears  it  was  disclosed  at  his  August  19,  2010  AUSA  proffer.  However,  Applicant’s \\nfailure to report the December 2007 security breach is not recent; the security breach \\nwas  inadvertent;  “it  happened  under  such  unique  circumstances  that  it  is  unlikely  to \\nrecur;”  and  it  “does  not  cast  doubt  on  Applicant’s  reliability,  trustworthiness,  or  good \\njudgment.”  He  admitted  that  he  showed  poor  judgment  in  December  2007  when  he \\ndiscovered that he had downloaded possible classified information onto B’s computer \\nand his own computer, and he failed to report this security breach to his FSO (SOR ¶ \\n\\n \\n11 \\n                                         \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "1.a).  Security  needed  to  assess  the  scope  of  the  breach  of  security  or  spillage,  and \\nsecurity was unable to check other computers and determine who was responsible for \\nthe “trusted download” that caused the security breach.  \\n\\n \\nApplicant  understands  the  importance  of  informing  security  of  any  security \\nbreach or possible security breach, and I am confident he will timely disclosed required \\ninformation. Personal conduct concerns are mitigated. Even if security concerns are not \\nmitigated under Guideline E, they are mitigated under the whole-person concept, infra. \\n \\nHandling Protected Information  \\n \\n  \\nAG  ¶  33  articulates  the  security  concern  relating  to  handling  protected \\ninformation  as  follows,  “Deliberate  or  negligent  failure  to  comply  with  rules  and \\nregulations for protecting classified or other sensitive information raises doubt about an \\nindividual’s trustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or willingness and ability to safeguard \\nsuch information, and is a serious security concern.” \\n\\n \\nAG  ¶  34  provides  three  disqualifying  conditions  that  could  raise  a  security \\n\\n  \\nconcern and may be disqualifying in this case:  \\n \\n\\n(b) collecting or storing classified or other protected information at home or \\nin any other unauthorized location; \\n \\n(c) loading, drafting, editing, modifying, storing, transmitting, or otherwise \\nhandling classified reports, data, or other information on any unapproved \\nequipment including but not limited to any typewriter, word processor, or \\ncomputer  hardware,  software,  drive,  system,  gameboard,  handheld, \\n\"palm\" or pocket device or other adjunct equipment; and \\n \\n(g) any failure to comply with rules for the protection of classified or other \\nsensitive information. \\n\\n \\n\\nAG ¶¶ 34(b), 34(c), and 34(g) apply. These three disqualifying conditions do not \\ninclude  a  requirement  that  Applicant  knew  he  was  downloading  classified  information \\nonto  an  unclassified  system,  and  they  do  not  require  that  he  be  aware  that  his \\nunclassified computer systems contain classified information.  \\n\\n \\nSOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.c discussed previously are cross-alleged under SOR ¶¶ 2.a \\nand  2.c.  In  December  2007,  Applicant  discovered  that  he  had  downloaded  possible \\nclassified  information  onto  B’s  computer  and  his  own  computer.  The  two  computers \\nwere not authorized for storage of classified information.   \\n\\n \\nThe hard drive of one of Applicant’s DOD-issued laptop computers was restricted \\nto unclassified information use, and a forensic evaluation and SME review found that his \\nlaptop computer contained some data classified at the confidential level. Applicant was \\nunaware  this  computer  contained  classified  information.  He  is  not  responsible  for \\n\\n \\n12 \\n                                         \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "“trusted  downloads,”  and  he  inadvertently  downloaded  classified  information  from  a \\ntrusted download onto his hard drive.  \\n\\n \\nThree mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 35 are potentially applicable:  \\n\\n \\n\\n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior, or it has happened so \\ninfrequently  or  under  such  unusual  circumstances,  that  it  is  unlikely  to \\nrecur  and  does  not  cast  doubt  on  the  individual's  current  reliability, \\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \\n \\n(b) the individual responded favorably to counseling or remedial security \\ntraining and now demonstrates a positive attitude toward the discharge of \\nsecurity responsibilities; and \\n \\n(c) the security violations were due to improper or inadequate training. \\n  \\nAG ¶¶ 35(a) through 35(c) apply. As indicated in the previous section, AG ¶ 35(a) \\nis  established.  The  particular  simulation  program  involving  inadvertent  transfers  of \\nclassified data to unclassified systems was changed to a completely classified system. \\nSuch  erroneous  “trusted  downloads”  will  not  recur.  Applicant  understands  how \\nimportant it is to avoid future transfers of classified information to unclassified computer \\nsystems.  He  has  been  counseled  and  understands  that  when  a  security  violation  is \\ndiscovered, it should be timely reported to his FSO. He has a positive attitude towards \\nconscientiously complying with security requirements.  \\n\\n \\nApplicant’s  actions  since  March  2008  show  sufficient  effort,  good  judgment, \\n  \\ntrustworthiness,  and  reliability  to  warrant  mitigation  of  handling  protected  information \\nsecurity  concerns.  Even  if  handling  protected  information  concerns  are  not  mitigated \\nunder Guideline K, they are mitigated under the whole-person concept, infra.    \\n\\n \\n\\nWhole-Person Concept \\n\\n \\n Under  the  whole-person  concept,  the  administrative  judge  must  evaluate  an \\nApplicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s \\nconduct  and all  the  circumstances. The  administrative  judge  should  consider  the nine \\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  \\n\\nthe  conduct, \\n\\nthe  nature,  extent,  and  seriousness  of \\nto \\n\\nthe  conduct;  (2) \\nthe \\n(1) \\ncircumstances  surrounding \\ninclude  knowledgeable \\nparticipation;  (3)  the  frequency  and  recency  of  the  conduct;  (4)  the \\nindividual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \\nwhich  participation \\nthe  presence  or  absence  of \\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \\nfor  the  conduct;  (8)  the  potential  for  pressure,  coercion,  exploitation,  or \\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \\n\\nis  voluntary;  (6) \\n\\n \\n13 \\n                                         \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "Under  AG  ¶  2(c),  the  ultimate  determination  of  whether  to  grant  eligibility  for  a \\nsecurity  clearance  must  be  an  overall  commonsense  judgment  based  upon  careful \\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \\ncomments under Guidelines E and K in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors \\nin AG ¶ 2(a)  were addressed under Guidelines  E and K, but some warrant additional \\ncomment. \\n\\n  \\nApplicant is a 56-year-old software engineer employed by Company D from 1980 \\nto 2007. From 2008 to present, he has been employed by another defense contractor. \\nHis spouse is a security clearance holder; his father was a career Navy officer; his two \\nolder brothers served in the Navy; and his nephew was a Navy Seal, who served three \\ntours  in  Afghanistan.  In  1982,  Applicant  received  a  bachelor  of  science  degree  in \\nmathematics.  During  Desert  Shield,  Applicant  was  deployed  for  six  months  to  the \\nPersian Gulf aboard a U.S. Navy vessel.   \\n\\n \\nA Navy captain, who has known Applicant since the late 1990s; a high-level DOD \\nemployee, who has oversight authority over about 9,000 of DOD employees and a $300 \\nmillion budget and who has known Applicant since the 1990s; a program director on a \\nproject,  who  has  known  Applicant  since  2003;  two  contractors,  who  worked  with \\nApplicant  on  the  project  at  issue;  and  Applicant’s  attorney  described  Applicant  in \\nlaudatory  terms.  Applicant  is  an  “incredibly  gifted,”  exceptionally  creative,  and \\n“incredibly skilled” technician and engineer. He is diligent, intelligent, professional, open, \\ncandid, honest, and conscientious about the protection of classified information. Most of \\nhis  character  witnesses  were  aware  of  the  SOR  allegations,  had  read  Applicant’s \\nstatements in 2011 and 2013, and recommended reinstatement of Applicant’s security \\nclearance.  \\n\\n \\nApplicant’s  SOR  allegations  relate  to  his  handling  of  confidential  information  in \\nDecember  2007  and  January  2008  and  participation  in  the  follow-up  investigation  in \\n2009  and  2010.  Company  L  or  Navy  employees  provided  “trusted  downloads”  to \\nApplicant and his team. The trusted downloads were not supposed to contain classified \\ndata or software; however, there was some classified data mixed in with the unclassified \\ndata. Applicant and other members of his team unknowingly downloaded the classified \\nand  unclassified  information  onto  computers  allocated  to  unclassified  information. \\nApplicant  did  not  compromise  classified  information  as  there  is  no  evidence  the \\nunclassified  computers  were  used  by  anyone  not  authorized  to  review  the  classified \\ninformation. In December 2007, Applicant discovered possible classified information on \\nhis unclassified computer and on B’s computer. B and Applicant agreed that they should \\ndelete  it,  and  they  did  so.  This  error  was  aggravated  when  Applicant  and  B  failed  to \\ndisclose the discovery of the probable classified information on the flash drive and their \\ncomputers  to  their  FSOs.  Applicant  did  not  receive  adequate  training  or  supervision \\nfrom  B,  a  GS-13  Navy  employee  on  this  occasion.  There  was  no  evidence  that \\nApplicant was told prior to December 2007 of the protocol after discovery of possible \\nclassified information on an unclassified computer.  \\n\\n \\nAfter  two  of  Applicant’s  assigned  DOD-issued  computers  were  requested,  he \\ndeleted Company D proprietary information and personal information before providing \\n\\n \\n14 \\n                                         \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "one  computer  to  Company  D  and  one  computer to  NCIS. These deletions  raised  the \\npossibility  that  he  was  intentionally  obstructing  the  investigation  because  forensic \\nexamination revealed there were deletions, but could not determine the content of the \\ndeletions.  Applicant  provided  the  only  evidence  of  the  content  of  the  deletions.  In \\nFebruary  2008,  after  Applicant  made  the  deletions,  he  hired  an  experienced  national \\nsecurity attorney who advised him to cooperate with the investigation. After March 2008, \\nApplicant  cooperated  with  the  investigation,  and  his  attorney  notified  the  FBI  that  he \\nwould assist the investigation. His errors in judgment were made from December 2007 \\nthrough February 2008 and are not recent.   \\n\\n \\nApplicant’s hearing statement was credible. He understands what he needs to do \\nto maintain his eligibility for access to classified information. He has avoided any hint of \\nviolation  of  his  employer’s  rules  or  security  rules  after  March  2008.  He  expressed \\nsincere remorse for his infractions of security rules and errors in judgment in December \\n2007  and  January  2008,  and  he  emphasized  his  determination  to  conscientiously \\ncomply  with  all  security  rules  and  requirements.  I  am  confident  he  will  continue  to \\nconscientiously exercise his security responsibilities in the future. \\n\\n    \\nI  have  carefully  applied  the  law,  as  set  forth  in  Egan,  Exec.  Or.  10865,  the \\nDirective,  and  the  AGs,  to  the  facts  and  circumstances  in  the  context  of  the  whole \\nperson.

Applicant  did  not  respond  to  the  FORM.  I  was \\nassigned the case on December 1, 2015. Based on a thorough review of the case file, I \\nfind that Applicant failed to carry his burden in mitigating security concerns arising under \\nboth Guideline B and Guideline E.  \\n\\n     Findings of Fact \\n\\n \\nApplicant  is  a  71-year-old  man  who  is  presently  not  working  while  his  security \\nclearance is updated. He has earned a high school diploma. He was divorced in 1998 \\n                                                           \\n1 The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \\nSecurity  Clearance  Review  Program  (January  2,  1992),  as  amended  (Directive);  and  the  adjudicative \\nguidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on September 1, 2006. \\n\\n1 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\n",
       "and is now estranged from a subsequent spouse. Facts about this estranged female are \\nunclear,  although  it  appears  she  is  from  Russia,  where  she  currently  resides  with  or \\nnear  family.  He  provided  incomplete  information  on  his  security  clearance  application \\n(SCA)  about  his  family  and  children.  Other  discrepancies  appear  throughout  his \\ninvestigatory record. Applicant presently lives in another country with a female foreign \\nnational  in  order  to  reduce  the  costs  he  would  otherwise  expend  living  in  the  United \\nStates while awaiting a return to work.  \\n \\n \\nAt issue in the SOR are the following facts: Applicant has a wife who is a citizen \\nand resident of Russia.2 They are estranged, but Applicant has no plans to divorce his \\nforeign  wife  because  he  no  longer  believes  in  divorce.  He  has  a  daughter  who  is  a \\ncitizen  of  the  United  States  and  is  currently  a  resident  of  Russia,  where  she  is  a \\nuniversity student. He also has parents-in-law who are citizens and residents of Russia. \\nApplicant met them in about July 1998 on a visit to their home. He again saw them on a \\nsubsequent  trip  to  Russia  with  his  wife.  He  has  had  no  other  contact  with  them  and \\ndoes not know how often his estranged wife currently has with her parents now that all \\nthree  are  in  Russia.  His  father-in-law  and  mother-in-law  are  a  teacher  and  a \\ngynecologist,  respectively.  Applicant  assumed  they  were  Communists  because  the \\nCommunists were in power when he met them. As of 2015, Russia is one of the two \\nleading state intelligence threats to United States interests, based on their capabilities, \\nintent,  and  broad  operational  scopes.3  Applicant  admits  the  Guideline  B  SOR \\nallegations, but did not address them in any manner in his SOR Response.     \\n \\n \\nIn completing SCAs in both August 3, 2009, and March 23, 2013, Applicant failed \\nto  list  multiple  names  he  has  used,  places  of  former  residence,  periods  of \\nunemployment, relatives, and foreign contacts. He told an investigator in 2010 that he \\nhad no problems while working with a particular employer, but later conceded he was \\ninvolved in a harassment suit while working there. Despite a 2010 claim to the contrary, \\nhe failed in 2007 to file an appropriate contact with foreign nationals report regarding the \\nforeign woman with whom he currently cohabitates. Applicant admits these allegations.  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\nPolicies \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nWhen  evaluating  an  applicant’s  suitability \\n\\n \\n \\nthe \\nadministrative  judge  must  consider  the  adjudicative  guidelines.  In  addition  to  brief \\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \\ndisqualifying  conditions  and  mitigating  conditions,  which  are  used  in  evaluating  an \\napplicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. \\n \\n\\nfor  a  security  clearance, \\n\\nThese  guidelines  are  not  inflexible  rules  of  law.  Instead,  recognizing  the \\ncomplexities  of  human  behavior,  these  guidelines  are  applied  in  conjunction  with  the \\n                                                           \\n2  In  some  records  within  the  FORM,  Applicant  indicated  that  his  estranged  wife  became  a  naturalized \\ncitizen in 2007 or 2008 and now resides in the United States, but the discrepancies are never resolved. \\n(See FORM, Item 6) \\n \\n3 FORM, Item 9, at 3. \\n\\n2 \\n\\n\n",
       "factors  listed  in  the  adjudicative  process.  The  administrative  judge’s  overarching \\nadjudicative  goal  is  a  fair,  impartial,  and  commonsense  decision.  According  to  AG  ¶ \\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \\nthe  “whole-person  concept.”  The  administrative  judge  must  consider  all  available, \\nreliable information about the person in making a decision. \\n\\n \\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) \\nrequires  that  “[a]ny  doubt  concerning  personnel  being  considered  for  access  to \\nclassified  information  will  be  resolved  in  favor  of  national  security.”  In  reaching  this \\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \\non the evidence contained in the record.  \\n\\n \\nUnder Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \\ncontroverted  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  Under  Directive  ¶  E3.1.15,  an  “applicant  is \\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \\nmitigate  facts  admitted  by  applicant  or  proven  by  Department  Counsel  and  has  the \\nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.”  \\n\\nthe  Government  predicated  upon \\n\\n \\nA  person  who  seeks  access  to  classified  information  enters  into  a  fiduciary \\nrelationship  with \\ntrust  and  confidence.  This \\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \\nGovernment  reposes  a  high  degree  of  trust  and  confidence  in  individuals  to  whom  it \\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \\nthe  possible  risk  the  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  safeguard \\nclassified information. Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall \\nbe “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \\nloyalty of the applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b).  \\n\\nThe security concern relating to the Guideline B is set out in AG ¶ 6: \\n\\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \\nany  foreign  interest.  Adjudication  under  this  Guideline  can  and  should \\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \\nfinancial \\nto,  such \\nconsiderations  as  whether  the  foreign  country  is  known  to  target  United \\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \\nrisk of terrorism. \\n\\nincluding,  but  not \\n\\nlocated, \\n\\ninterest \\n\\nlimited \\n\\nis \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n3 \\n\\nAnalysis \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\n",
       "Applicant remains married to the female of Russian origin at issue. Therefore, it \\ncan be assumed he maintains some level of affection for this woman, the mother of his \\nchild. It can also be assumed he maintains a bond or ties of affection for their child, who \\nis  now  studying  at  a  Russian  college.  As  for  his  in-laws,  while  their  contact  with \\nApplicant is negligible, it can be assumed his estranged partner has ties of affection with \\nher own parents. Those ties are routinely attributed to the spouse (Applicant) in these \\ncases. Given these facts, disqualifying conditions AG ¶¶ 7(a) and (b) apply:  \\n \\n\\nto  protect  sensitive \\n\\nAG ¶ 7(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \\nassociate,  friend,  or  other  person  who  is  a  citizen  of  or  resident  in  a \\nforeign  country  if  that  contact  creates  a  heightened  risk  of  foreign \\nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \\n \\nAG ¶ 7(b) connection to a foreign person, group, government, or country \\nthat  create  a  potential  conflict  of  interest  between  the  individual’s \\nobligation \\nthe \\nindividual’s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \\nthat information. \\n \\nIn  finding  disqualifying  conditions  applicable,  I  specifically  note  that  AG  ¶  7(a) \\nrequires substantial evidence of a heightened risk. The heightened risk required to raise \\na  disqualifying  condition  is  a  relatively  low  standard.  Heightened  risk  denotes  a  risk \\ngreater than the normal risk inherent in having a family member living under a foreign \\ngovernment or substantial assets in a foreign nation. Russia is one of the two leading \\nstate intelligence threats to United States interests. In addition, foreign family ties can \\npose a security risk even without a connection to a foreign government. This is because \\nan applicant may be subject to coercion or undue influence when a third party pressures \\nor  threatens  an  applicant’s family  members.  Under  these facts,  while  unlikely,  a  third \\nparty  coercion  concern  potentially  exists  in  Russia.  Therefore,  there  is  sufficient \\nevidence to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \\n\\ninformation  or \\n\\ntechnology  and \\n\\n  \\nAG ¶ 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \\n\\nof the mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 8, and find the following are relevant: \\n \\n\\nAG ¶ 8(a) the nature of the relationship with foreign persons, the country in \\nwhich  these  persons  are  located,  or  the  positions  or  activities  of  those \\npersons  in  that  country  are  such  that  it  is  unlikely  the  individual  will  be \\nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \\nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.; \\nand \\n\\n \\n\\nAG  ¶  8(b)  there  is  no  conflict  of  interest,  either  because  the  individual’s \\nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or \\ncountry  is  so  minimal,  or  the  individual  has  such  deep  and  longstanding \\nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to \\nresolve any conflict of interests in favor of the U.S. interests.  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n4 \\n\\n\n",
       "The mere possession of close family ties to persons in a foreign country is not, \\nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in \\na foreign country and an applicant has frequent, non-casual contacts with that relative, \\nthis  factor  alone  is  sufficient  to  create  the  potential  for  foreign  influence  and  could \\npotentially result in the compromise of classified information.  \\n\\n \\nHere,  Applicant  provided  scant  information about  his estranged  wife,  daughter, \\nand  in-laws.  Indeed,  information  about  his  in-laws  is  more  abundant  than  information \\nabout his child and her mother. While his personal ties to his in-laws may be weak, their \\nimpact on Applicant cannot be discerned without more information about his wife and \\nchild. Under these limited facts, no mitigating conditions weigh in Applicant’s favor. \\n\\nThe  security  concern  for  personal  conduct  is  set  out  in  AG  ¶  15,  where  the \\nsignificance of conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \\nunwillingness  to  comply  with  rules  and  regulations  is  defined  ([p]ersonal  conduct  can \\nraise  questions  about  an  individual’s  reliability,  trustworthiness  and  ability  to  protect \\nclassified  information).  Of  special  interest  is  any  failure to  provide  truthful and  candid \\nanswers during the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the \\nsecurity clearance process.  \\n\\n \\nIn completing his 2009 and 2013 SCAs, Applicant’s answers in many areas were \\neither deficient or in conflict. His answers in a 2010 interview were either intentionally or \\nnegligently incomplete  with regard to past  workplace problems and the reporting of a \\nforeign  cohabitant  to  his  former  employer.  If  these  inaccuracies  were  intentionally \\nincorrect, such facts could give rise to:  \\n\\n \\nAG  ¶  16(a)  deliberate  omission,  concealment,  or  falsification  of  relevant \\nfacts \\nfrom  any  personnel  security  questionnaire,  personal  history \\nstatement,  or  similar  form  used  to  conduct  investigations,  determine \\nemployment  qualifications,  award  benefits  or  status,  determine  security \\nclearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities, \\nand  \\n \\nAG  ¶  16(b)  deliberately  providing \\ninformation \\nconcerning  relevant  facts  to  an  employer,  investigator,  security  official, \\ncompetent medical authority, or other official government representative. \\n \\nApplicant admitted all three allegations raised under Guideline E and provided no \\nexplanations or commentary. While his admission to the SCA discrepancies could be \\ndiscounted and his discrepancies found to be the product of negligence, this guideline \\ncould  be  found  in  his  favor.  In  admitting  allegations  that  he  knowingly  withheld \\ninformation and denied having had problems while employed at a place where he was \\ninvolved in a harassment suit, however, the facts tend to indicate that these answers – \\nwithout  more  –  were  intentionally  false  or  misleading.  This  is  particularly  true  in  the \\n5 \\n\\nfalse  or  misleading \\n\\n \\n\\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "absence  of  some  explanation  claiming  forgetfulness  or  another  basis  for  having \\nprovided a negligently entered SCA answer. Therefore, given his admissions, none of \\nthe mitigating conditions at AG ¶ 17(a) – (g) apply.  \\n\\nWhole-Person Concept \\n \\n \\nUnder  the  whole-person  concept,  the  administrative  judge  must  evaluate  an \\napplicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s \\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a). Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) \\nwere addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment.  \\n \\n \\nApplicant failed to do more than admit the allegations raised in the SOR. He then \\nrequested a judgment based on the written record. It is that very record that is full of \\ndiscrepancies  and  contradictions  that  contributed  to  the  security  concerns  at  issue. \\nThere  are  simply  insufficient  facts  to  evaluate  Applicant’s  foreign  kin,  the  SCA  and \\ninterview inaccuracies, or even the Applicant as an individual. This is simply the result of \\na  deficiently  supplemented  record.  Without  more,  there  is  insufficient  information  to \\nrebut, refute, or mitigate the security concerns raised under the foreign influence and \\npersonal conduct guidelines.   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nFOREIGN INFLUENCE  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nAllegations 1.a-1.c:   \\n\\nPERSONAL CONDUCT \\n  \\n \\n\\nAllegations 2.a-2.c:   \\n\\n \\n\\nFormal Findings \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nAGAINST APPLICANT \\n\\nAgainst Applicant \\n\\nAGAINST APPLICANT \\n\\nAgainst Applicant  \\n\\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n     Conclusion \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \\nclearly  consistent  with  the  national  interest  to  grant  Applicant  a  security  clearance. \\nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n                                             \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n_____________________________ \\n\\n \\n\\nArthur E.

He  was  also  advised  of  the  serious \\nsecurity concerns raised by his possession of a current foreign passport and that such \\nconcerns may be mitigated by surrendering or relinquishing the passport as set forth in \\nthe Directive.4 Applicant did not submit a response or provide additional documentation. \\nThe record closed on December 15, 2015. \\n \\n\\nOn  August  31,  2015,  Applicant  acknowledged  receipt  of  the  FORM.3  He  was \\n\\nAdministrative Notice: The Russian Federation (Russia) \\n\\nDOHA  administrative \\n\\njudges  may  accept \\n\\n \\n \\nfor  administrative  notice \\nuncontroverted,  easily  verifiable  facts  regarding  a  foreign  country  from  official  U.S. \\nGovernment reports.

He received a commission \\nas an officer in Russia’s reserve military forces and worked for a time for the Russian \\nDefense Ministry. He immigrated to the United States in 1997 and married his wife, who \\nis also originally from Russia, in 2002. They have one child, who was born in the United \\nStates.  \\n \\n\\nApplicant  became  a  U.S.  citizen  in  2005.  Applicant,  his  wife,  and  his  child  all \\nhave  dual  U.S.-Russian  citizenships.  Since  becoming  a  U.S.  citizen,  Applicant  has \\n                                                           \\n5  Department  Counsel’s  “failure”  to  submit  the  source  documents  is  understandable  as  the  FORM \\npredates  the  cited  Appeal  Board  decision.

However, based on the present record, I cannot find that Applicant’s failure to raise an objection to \\nEx. 5 amounts to an agreement as to the exhibits accuracy, reliability, and relevancy. Contrast with, ISCR \\nCase No. 14-03112 (App. Bd. Nov. 3, 2015), after applicant concurred with its content, the only evidence \\nregarding the foreign country was the administrative notice request that was admitted as a summary. \\n \\n6 Applicant was provided notice regarding these source documents with the FORM. He was also provided \\nample opportunity to challenge or provide additional information regarding the matters requested by the \\nGovernment for administrative notice. Although the Government’s citation to 26 source documents raises \\npotential notice and fairness concerns, the additional time Applicant was provided to respond and provide \\nadditional information ameliorated any such concerns.  \\n \\n7  Director  of  National  Intelligence,  Statement  for  the  Record,  Senate  Armed  Services  Committee, \\nWorldwide Threat Assessment of the U.S. Intelligence Community at 4, February 26, 2015.  \\n \\n8 U.S. State Department, Russia 2013 Human Rights Report at 1.  \\n \\n9 Id. at 1-2.  \\n\\nFindings of Fact \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n3 \\n \\n \\n\\n\n",

He is unwilling to surrender or relinquish his \\nRussian passport because he may need it to travel to Russia on short notice to visit his \\nelderly parents.  \\n \\n\\nApplicant has a number connections and contacts in Russia. Notably, Applicant’s \\nparents  and  his  wife’s  mother  and  her  siblings  are  citizens  and  residents  of  Russia. \\nApplicant’s  father  used  to  work  for  the  Russian  government.

Individual  applicants  are  eligible  for  access  to \\nclassified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent  with  the  national \\ninterest” to authorize such access. E.O. 10865 § 2. \\n\\n \\nWhen  evaluating  an  applicant’s  eligibility \\n\\nfor  a  security  clearance,  an \\nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \\nintroductory  explanations,  the  guidelines  list  potentially  disqualifying  and  mitigating \\nconditions.  The  guidelines  are  not  inflexible  rules  of  law.  Instead,  recognizing  the \\ncomplexities  of  human  behavior,  an  administrative  judge  applies  the  guidelines  in  a  \\ncommonsense manner, considering all available and reliable information, in arriving at a \\nfair and impartial decision.  \\n\\n \\nDepartment  Counsel  must  present  evidence  to  establish  controverted  facts \\nalleged  in  the  SOR.  Directive  ¶  E3.1.14.  Applicants  are  responsible  for  presenting \\n“witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by \\nthe applicant or proven . . . and has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a \\nfavorable clearance decision.” Directive ¶ E3.1.15.  \\n\\n \\nAdministrative Judges are responsible for ensuring that due process proceedings \\nare conducted “in a fair, timely and orderly manner.” Directive ¶ E3.1.10. Judges make \\ncertain  that  an  applicant  receives  fair  notice  of  the  issues  raised,  has  a  reasonable \\nopportunity to litigate those issues, and is not subjected to unfair surprise. ISCR Case \\nNo. 12-01266 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 4, 2014).  \\n\\n \\nIn  resolving  the  ultimate  question  regarding  an  applicant’s  eligibility,  an \\nadministrative judge must resolve “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered \\nfor  access  to  classified  information  .  .  .  in  favor  of  national  security.”  AG  ¶  2(b). \\nMoreover, recognizing the difficulty at times in making suitability determinations and the \\nparamount importance of protecting national security, the Supreme Court has held that \\n\\n \\n4 \\n \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "“security  clearance  determinations  should  err,  if  they  must,  on  the  side  of  denials.” \\nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \\n\\nthe  Government  predicated  upon \\n\\n \\nA  person  who  seeks  access  to  classified  information  enters  into  a  fiduciary \\n \\nrelationship  with \\ntrust  and  confidence.  This \\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of \\ntrust  and  confidence  in  individuals  to  whom  it  grants  access  to  classified  information. \\nDecisions  include,  by  necessity,  consideration  of  the  possible  risk  an  applicant  may \\ndeliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  safeguard  classified  information.  Such  decisions \\nentail  a  certain  degree  of  legally  permissible  extrapolation  of  potential,  rather  than \\nactual, risk of compromise of classified information. \\n \\n\\nClearance  decisions  must  be  made  “in  terms  of  the  national  interest  and  shall \\nin  no  sense  be  a  determination  as  to  the  loyalty  of  the  applicant  concerned.”  E.O. \\n10865 § 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance amounts to a finding that an \\napplicant,  at  the  time  the  decision  was  rendered,  did  not  meet  the  strict  guidelines \\nestablished for determining eligibility for access to classified information. \\n\\n \\n\\nAnalysis \\n\\n \\n\\nGuideline C, Foreign Preference  \\n \\n \\nUnder  AG  ¶  9,  the  foreign  preference  security  concern  arises  “[w]hen  an \\nindividual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the \\nUnited States.” Applicant actively exercised his foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. \\ncitizen,  including  voting  in  Russian  elections  and  renewing,  using,  and  maintaining  a \\nRussian passport. This record evidence raises the foreign preference security concern \\nand  establishes  the  disqualifying  condition  at  AG  ¶  10(a).10  The  foreign  preference \\nguideline also sets forth a number of potential mitigation conditions. I have considered \\nall the mitigating conditions and none apply. Notably, Applicant currently has a foreign \\npassport and is unwilling to relinquish or surrender it.

Even  if  I  assume  for  the  sake  of  argument  that \\nApplicant’s property and non-familial connections in Russia are not significant enough to \\ncause  a  conflict  of  interest  with  his  security  obligations,  his  and  his  wife’s  close \\nrelationship to their family members in Russia raise a concern about his vulnerability or \\nsusceptibility to adverse foreign influence.

Moreover, Russia has been identified by the U.S. Government as \\ncontinuing  to  pose  an  intelligence  threat.  Applicant’s  familial  connections  in  Russia, \\ncoupled with the threat posed by the current Russian government to its own people and \\nthe security threat it poses to the United States, raises a heightened risk that Applicant \\ncould  be  subjected  to  adverse  foreign  influence.  Applicant  did  not  present  sufficient \\ninformation  to  mitigate  this  security  concern.  However,  this  adverse  finding  is  “not  a \\ncomment on Applicant’s patriotism but merely an acknowledgment that people may act \\nin unpredictable ways when faced with choices that could be important to a loved-one, \\nsuch as a family member.” ISCR Case No. 08-10025 at 4 (App. Bd.

       "The Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On\\nOctober 17, 2014, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\\ndecision–security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of\\nDefense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). Applicant  requested a hearing.\\nOn  November  21,  2015,  after  the  hearing,  Defense  Office  of  Hearings  and  Appeals  (DOHA)\\nAdministrative  Judge  Francisco  Mendez  denied  Applicant’s  request  for  a  security  clearance.\\nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive ¶¶ E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\\n\\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge’s adverse decision was\\n\\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\\n\\nThe Judge’s Findings of Fact\\n\\nThe Judge made the following findings pertinent to the issues raised on appeal.  Applicant\\nhas been continuously employed since 2004 and has held a clearance since 2008.  He owes the IRS\\nabout  $40,000  for  unpaid  taxes  from  tax  years  2005  through  2012  and  for  2014.1    Applicant\\nattributed his tax problems to his having spent funds on a wedding rather than his taxes, as well as\\nto inadequate withholding.  Over the past several years Applicant has entered into a number of\\ninstallment agreements with the IRS.  When he is unable to pay, he contacts the IRS and negotiates\\na new agreement.  Applicant has resolved other debts alleged in the SOR.  He has about $700 in\\ndiscretionary income each month.  His budget does not show any payments to the IRS.\\n\\nThe Judge’s Analysis\\n\\nThe Judge cleared Applicant of all SOR debts except those pertaining to his delinquent taxes.\\nHe noted that Applicant has been fully employed for many years but has consistently failed to pay\\nhis taxes in full.  The Judge noted that Applicant did not pay his 2014 taxes, which would have\\nbecome due after the receipt of the SOR.  The Judge concluded that not even the possible loss of a\\nsecurity clearance could motivate Applicant to change his financial habits.\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\nApplicant cites to evidence that he has resolved other SOR debts.  He also points to his latest\\nrepayment plan that, he argues, will enable him to resolve his tax delinquencies.  Applicant’s\\nargument is not sufficient to rebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the evidence in\\nthe record.  Neither is it sufficient to show that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was\\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-06093 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 4,\\n2015).  \\n\\n1The SOR alleged tax debts up through tax year 2011.  The Judge stated that he was considering the non-alleged\\n\\ndebts only in evaluating Applicant’s case for mitigation and the whole-person factors.  Decision at 3, note 7.  \\n\\n2\\n\\n\n",
       "Applicant requests an opportunity to present us with additional information about his budget,\\npayments to the IRS, and resolution of other debts.  His brief also refers to matters from outside the\\nrecord.  We are not able to consider new evidence on appeal.  Directive ¶ E3.1.29.  Applicant notes\\nthat the attorney who represented him at the hearing had requested the Judge not to consider several\\npages of the transcript due to a malfunction with the video-teleconference equipment.  The Judge\\nstated that he did not consider these pages.  Decision at 2, note 6.  Therefore, any technical problem\\nthat may have occurred did not impair Applicant’s receipt of due process.  \\n\\nThe Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the\\ndecision.  The decision is sustainable on this record.  “The general standard is that a clearance may\\nbe granted only when ‘clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.’”  Department\\nof the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).

The  SOR  alleged  security \\nconcerns under Guidelines E (Personal Conduct), B (Foreign Influence), and M (Use of \\nInformation  Technology  Systems),  and  detailed  reasons  why  the  DOD  adjudicators \\nwere  unable  to  find  that  it  is  clearly  consistent  with  the  national  interest  to  grant  or \\ncontinue  a  security  clearance  for  Applicant.  The  SOR  recommended  referral  to  an \\nadministrative  judge  to  determine  whether  a  clearance  should  be  granted,  continued, \\ndenied, or revoked.  \\n\\n \\n \\nApplicant  received  the  SOR  on  January  28,  2015.

       "Applicant  received  a  bachelor  of  arts  degree  in  Computer  Science  in  May  1981.7 \\nApplicant  was  married  in  August  1984,  separated  in  December  2009,  and  divorced  in \\nJuly  2010.  He  married  his  current  wife  in  October  2014.8  He  adopted  his  first  wife’s \\ndaughter (born in 1976) in the mid-1980’s.9 \\n\\nApplicant and his first wife started drifting apart and went through several years \\nfilled with marital issues leading up to their separation and actual divorce. She refused \\nto  attend  Applicant’s  father’s  funeral  in  1995,  his  mother’s  funeral  in  1999,  his  college \\nreunion, or his niece’s wedding in 2008. He claimed  it got to the point where he asked \\nher  to  help  him  with  something  and  she  refused.  He  experienced  a  difficult  residence \\nreconstruction  project.  There  was  a  lack  of  communication  between  Applicant  and  his \\nwife.  After  the  separation,  attempted  reconciliations  failed.  During  the  period  of  his \\nseparation,  an  employer’s  contract  ended  and  his  position  was  vacated.  He  searched \\nfor  a  new  position,  and  actually  obtained  several  short-term  ones.  During  the  period \\n2004 until 2013, 18 friends or relatives passed away. Applicant incurred several injuries, \\nillnesses,  and  conditions,  and  he  went  through  several  surgeries.  At  least  one  very \\nclose friend noticed the emotional stress that the various issues were causing Applicant. \\nTo  minimize  the  stress  which  really  started  to  affect  him  in  about  2006,  and  to  relax, \\nApplicant \\nturned  to  playing  Internet  games  and  chatting  during  online  dating \\nrelationships.10 \\n\\n \\n\\nUse of Information Technology Systems & Personal Conduct \\n  \\n\\n(SOR  ¶¶  1.a.  and  3.a.):  Applicant  was  employed  by  a  particular  government \\ncontractor  from  May  2010  until  July  2010.  On  or  about  July  24,  2010,  Applicant  was \\nlooking through his personal e-mails on his government furnished equipment (GFE), a \\ncomputer,  and  accessed  some  online  dating  sites,  sports  sites,  and  book  sites. When \\nhe  opened  some  unsolicited  e-mails,  he  found  that  they  contained  photos  of  nude \\nwomen.  One  e-mail  contained  one  photo  of  five  nude  women  and  another  e-mail  had \\none  photo  which  he  considered  offensive,  but  did  not  describe.  He  claimed  that  if  he \\nhad  known  the  e-mails  contained  photos  of  nude  women,  he  would  not  have  opened \\nthem  on  his  office  GFE.  He  immediately  deleted  the  e-mails  after  conferring  with  a \\ncolleague.  Applicant  denied  that  he  ever  intentionally  used  his  GFE  to  look  at \\npornographic photos. This was the only time any of the e-mails he opened on his GFE \\ncontained photos of nude women. In addition, Applicant’s GFE computer screen saver \\nand  wall  paper  contained  approximately  eight  photos  of  his  scantly  clothed  girlfriend \\nwhich were not pornographic.11  \\n                                                           \\n \\n\\n7 GE 1, supra note 1, at 13; AE H (Diploma, dated May 23, 1981); AE F, supra note 4, at 1. \\n \\n8 GE 1, supra note 1, at 28-29; Tr. at 46 \\n \\n9 Tr. at 47-48. \\n \\n10 AE B (Biography, dated February 15, 2015), at 2-3; Applicant’s Answer to the SOR, supra note 3, at 3-5, \\n\\n8; Tr. at 29-33, 46-48, 53-54. \\n\\n \\n11 GE 3 (Personal Subject Interview, dated November 18, 2010), at 1-2; GE 3 (Personal Subject Interview, \\n\\ndated December 6, 2010), at 1; Tr. at 50-51, 54; Applicant’s Answer to the SOR, supra note 3, at 1-2. \\n\\n \\n3 \\n                                      \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "On  or  about  July  27,  2010,  one  of  Applicant’s  supervisors  approached  him  and \\nasked  to  see  the  photos  of  his  residence  reconstruction  project.  Applicant’s  GFE \\ncomputer wallpaper included photographs of his then-girlfriend in a bikini. After viewing \\nher photos and photos of the residence, the supervisor departed. What occurred next is \\nunclear.  Applicant  was  initially  of  the  belief  that  she  went  directly  to  the  information \\ntechnology  (IT)  department  and  asked  that  Applicant’s  GFE  computer  be  scanned. \\nThere is also some evidence that Applicant’s  GFE was merely randomly scanned. The \\nactual fact in this regard in unimportant. According to an incident report filed on July 30, \\n2010, the scan of Applicant’s GFE found that he had been accessing websites for online \\ndating which were characterized as “inappropriate,” as well as 15 photos that were also \\ncharacterized as “inappropriate.” Two of the photos were deemed “sexually explicit” and \\n“pornographic” in nature.12  \\n\\n \\nOn  July  28,  2010,  Applicant  was  terminated  from  his  employment  without \\nwarning due to “violation of company policy” and “unauthorized use of GFE for sexually \\nexplicit  or  sexually  oriented materials.”13  Although  the  SOR  alleged  that Applicant  was \\nterminated  from  employment  for  “viewing  pornographic  websites,”  the  evidence  upon \\nwhich  the  allegations  are  based,  the  Incident  History,  simply  refers  to  them  as \\n“inappropriate websites.”14 The two terms are not synonymous. \\n\\n \\nThere  is  no  IT  report  of  specific  findings,  a  report  of  investigation  by  the \\nemployer, a copy of the company policy supposedly violated by Applicant, copies of the \\ntroublesome  photographs,  or  explicit  descriptions  of  what  were  construed  as  sexually \\nexplicit  of  pornographic,  in  evidence.  There  is  no  evidence  of  any  subsequent  alleged \\nmisuse of GFE or violations of company policies.15 \\n\\n \\n\\nForeign Influence \\n \\n \\nOver  a  period  estimated  by  Applicant  to  be  15  months,  Applicant  chatted  with \\nvarious  foreign  individuals  while  playing  online  games  and  involved  in  online  dating.  He \\nexplained  that  to  be  successful  in  these  games,  it  was  necessary  to  “ally”  with  as  many \\nindividuals  as  possible  to  assist  him  in  winning.  The  games  required  communication  and \\noccasional  chats.  Applicant’s  online  dating  resulted  in  “relationships”  with  several  foreign \\nwomen, but none of those “relationships” involved physically seeing or meeting the women \\nexcept by telephone, or photographs and videos.  \\n \\n\\nOne such “relationship” with a woman in the Philippines in November 2009 involved \\nhis sending various sums of money to her via Western Union. Applicant’s two explanations \\nregarding  the  amounts  sent  her  are  inconsistent.  He  told  an  investigator  from  the  U.S. \\nOffice  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM)  in  October  2010  that  he  had  sent  her  $6,000  for \\nplane reservations, $7,000 for her father’s medical care, and $25 for support.  He changed \\n                                                                                                                                                                                           \\n\\n \\n12 Tr. at 82-83; GE 3 (Personal Subject Interview (November 18, 2010)), supra note 11, at 1. \\n \\n13 GE 2 (Incident Report, dated August 6, 2013). \\n \\n14 GE 2, supra note 13. \\n \\n15 Tr. at 56. \\n\\n \\n4 \\n                                      \\n \\n\\n\n",

He  also  sent  her  various  sums  of  money  via  Western  Union.  Once  again, \\nApplicant’s  two  explanations  regarding  the  amounts  sent  her  are  inconsistent.  He  told  the \\nOPM investigator that he had sent her $20,000 for plane reservations, $3,000 to have her \\nreleased from Thai customs because she supposedly possessed gold bars, and $37,000 for \\nplane  reservations  to  return  home.  He  changed  the  amounts  during  the  hearing,  and  said \\nhe sent her $2,000 for plane reservations. He added that he also sent her unspecified sums \\non  over  ten  occasions.  Western  Union  eventually  stopped  Applicant  from  sending  funds \\noverseas.  When  she  asked  for  more,  he  said  no,  and  the  “relationship”  ended.17  Once \\nagain, because Applicant’s initial explanation was only months after the fact, and the most \\nrecent  one  was  five  years  later,  I  have  given  the  initial  explanation  more  weight  as  being \\nmore reliable. \\n \\nOn  an  unspecified  date,  Applicant  established  another  “relationship”  with  a  woman \\n \\nfrom the Philippines. He sent her various sums of money via Money Gram. Applicant’s two \\nexplanations regarding the amounts sent her are inconsistent. He told the OPM investigator \\nthat he had sent her $200 to pay her way out of her contract with her handler, and $50 for \\nliving expenses. He changed the amounts during the hearing, and said he sent her $370 to \\nbuy  out  her  contract.  The  “relationship”  ended.18  Once  again,  because  Applicant’s  initial \\nexplanation was only months after the fact, and the most recent one was five years later, I \\nhave given the initial explanation more weight as being more reliable. \\n \\n\\nIn November 2009, Applicant established another “relationship” with a woman from \\nthe Philippines. He sent her an unspecified sum of money to travel to the United States, but \\nshe used it for other purposes. When she requested additional money, he refused to send it \\nand the “relationship” ended.19 \\n\\n \\nApplicant  met  other  foreign  women  over  the  Internet,  but  none  of  those  involved \\nsending  money  to  them,  even  though  some  of  the  women  requested  money.  He \\nacknowledged that some of the women were taking advantage of him in scams, but he was \\nnot aware of the truth until later. He denied having a bond of affection, loyalty, or friendship \\nobligation  for  any  of  the  foreign  nationals  with  whom  he  had  the  aforementioned \\n“relationships.” Applicant entered into an exclusive relationship with the woman who is now \\nhis  wife  in  May  2011.

Once the Government has produced \\nsubstantial  evidence  of  a  disqualifying  condition,  under  Directive  ¶  E3.1.15,  the \\napplicant  has  the  burden  of  persuasion  to  present  evidence  in  refutation,  explanation, \\nextenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s \\ncase. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.36  \\n\\nthe  Government  predicated  upon \\n\\n \\nA  person  who  seeks  access  to  classified  information  enters  into  a  fiduciary \\ntrust  and  confidence.  This \\nrelationship  with \\nrelationship  transcends  normal  duty  hours  and  endures  throughout  off-duty  hours  as \\nwell.  It  is  because  of  this  special  relationship  that  the  Government  must  be  able  to \\nrepose  a  high  degree  of  trust  and  confidence  in  those  individuals  to  whom  it  grants \\naccess  to  classified  information.  Decisions  include,  by  necessity,  consideration  of  the \\npossible  risk  the applicant may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to safeguard  classified \\ninformation. Such decisions  entail  a  certain degree  of  legally  permissible  extrapolation \\nas  to  potential,  rather  than  actual,  risk  of  compromise  of  classified  information.  \\nFurthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of \\ndenials.”37 \\n\\n \\nClearance  decisions  must  be  “in  terms  of  the  national  interest  and  shall  in  no \\nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”38 Thus, nothing \\nin this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole \\nor in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, \\nor  patriotism.

A subsequent computer scan of his GFE conducted by the \\nIT department revealed the access to the “inappropriate” website as well as the photos \\nthat  were  characterized  as  “inappropriate.”  Two  of  the  photos  were  deemed  “explicit” \\nand  “pornographic”  in  nature.  As  a  result,  the  following  day,  Applicant  was  terminated \\nfrom his employment due to “violation of company policy” and “unauthorized use of GFE \\nfor sexually explicit or sexually oriented materials.” AG ¶ 40(e) has been established. \\n \\n \\nThe  guideline  also  includes  examples  of  conditions  that  could  mitigate  such \\nsecurity  concerns.

Of  special  interest  is  any  failure  to  provide  truthful \\nand  candid  answers  during  the  security  clearance  process  or  any  other \\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \\n \\nThe  guideline  notes  conditions  that  could  raise  security  concerns.  Under  AG  ¶ \\n\\n16(c), security concerns may be raised by:  \\n\\ncredible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is not \\nsufficient  for  an  adverse  determination  under  any  other  single  guideline, \\nbut  which,  when  considered  as  a  whole,  supports  a  whole-person \\nassessment  of  questionable  judgment,  untrustworthiness,  unreliability, \\nlack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \\ncharacteristics  indicating  that  the  person  may  not  properly  safeguard \\nprotected information. \\n\\nAlso, it is potentially disqualifying under AG ¶ 16(e) when there is: \\n\\npersonal conduct, or concealment of information about one’s conduct, that \\ncreates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1) \\nengaging  in  activities  which,  if  known,  may  affect  the  person’s  personal, \\nprofessional, or community standing. . . .  \\n\\nThe  alleged  behavior  consisted  of  being  involuntarily  terminated  from  his \\nemployment  in  July  2010  for  “viewing  pornographic  websites.”  Applicant  has  been \\nconsistent  in  his  rendition  of  the  facts.  The  evidence  is  not  in  dispute.  Applicant  was \\ninvoluntarily  terminated  from  his  employment  due  to  “violation  of  company  policy”  and \\n“unauthorized  use  of  GFE  for  sexually  explicit  or  sexually  oriented  materials.”  The  IT \\nscan  of  Applicant’s  GFE  revealed  that  he  viewed  an  “inappropriate”  online  dating \\nwebsite, but there is zero evidence that the website was “pornographic” in nature.

       "allegation  failed  to  address  the  issues  related  to  the  e-mails.  Nevertheless,  there  is \\nreason for further discussion. AG ¶¶ 16(c) and 16(e) have been partially established.  \\n\\n \\nThe  guideline  also  includes  examples  of  conditions  that  could  mitigate  security \\nconcerns  arising  from  personal  conduct.  AG  ¶  17(c)  may  apply  if  “the  offense  is  so \\nminor,  or  so  much  time  has  passed,  or  the  behavior  is  so  infrequent,  or  it  happened \\nunder such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on \\nthe individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.”  \\n\\n \\nSimilarly, AG ¶ 17(d) may apply if “the individual has acknowledged the behavior \\nand  obtained  counseling  to  change  the  behavior  or  taken  other  positive  steps  to \\nalleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \\nor  other  inappropriate  behavior,  and  such  behavior  is  unlikely  to  recur.”  Also,  if  “the \\nindividual  has  taken  positive  steps  to  reduce  or  eliminate  vulnerability  to  exploitation, \\nmanipulation, or duress,” AG ¶ 17(e) may apply. \\n\\n  \\nIn  July  2010,  during  a  period  when  Applicant  was  under  substantial  emotional \\nstress,  he  was  involuntarily  terminated  from  his  employment  due  to  “violation  of \\ncompany policy” and “unauthorized use of GFE for sexually explicit or sexually oriented \\nmaterials.” The alleged behavior, both the viewing of an “inappropriate website as well \\nas  the  opening  of  unsolicited  e-mails  each  occurred  on  one  occasion,  over  four  and \\none-half years before the SOR was issued. Applicant took positive efforts to reduce or \\neliminate  the  behavior  of  online  dating  and  game-playing.  He  remarried.  He  was \\nsubsequently  evaluated  by  a  licensed  psychologist  and  found  to  be  free  of  any \\npsychological  disorders.  He  acknowledged  his  behavior.  There  is  no  evidence  of  any \\nsubsequent  alleged  personal  conduct.  Considering  the  fact  that  the  “inappropriate” \\nwebsite dealt with online dating, and not pornography, the significance of the personal \\nconduct  is  minimized.  Applicant  has  reduced  or  eliminated  his  vulnerability  to \\nexploitation, and through his rehabilitative efforts, the  alleged untrustworthy, unreliable, \\nor other inappropriate behavior, is unlikely to recur. AG ¶¶ 17(c), 17(d), and 17(e) apply. \\n \\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \\n \\n\\nThe security concern under the Foreign Influence guideline is set out in AG ¶ 6:       \\n\\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \\nany  foreign  interest.  Adjudication  under  this  Guideline  can  and  should \\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \\nfinancial \\nto,  such \\nconsiderations  as  whether  the  foreign  country  is  known  to  target  United \\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \\nrisk of terrorism. \\n\\nincluding,  but  not \\n\\ninterest \\n\\nis \\n\\nlocated, \\n\\nlimited \\n\\n \\n\\n11 \\n\\n                                      \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \\nAG  ¶  7(a),  it  is  potentially  disqualifying  where  there  is  “contact  with  a  foreign  family \\nmember, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of \\nor  resident  in  a  foreign  country  if  that  contact  creates  a  heightened  risk  of  foreign \\nexploitation,  inducement,  manipulation,  pressure,  or  coercion.”  Similarly,  under  AG  ¶ \\n7(e), security concerns may be raised when there is  “a substantial business, financial, \\nor  property  interest  in  a  foreign  country,  or  in  any  foreign-owned  or  foreign-operated \\nbusiness,  which  could  subject  the  individual  to  heightened  risk  of  foreign  influence  or \\nexploitation.  \\n\\nApplicant  is  not  a  naturalized  U.S.  citizen.  He  was  born  in  the  United  States  of \\nparents  who  were  also  born  in  the  United  States.  His  entire  immediate  and  extended \\nfamily members are also U.S. citizens. There is no evidence (or allegations) that he has \\nany  family  members  or  business  or  professional  associates  who  are  citizens  or \\nresidents of a foreign  country. In 2009 and 2010, he did, however, have long-distance \\nonline and telephone relationships with several women who were foreign-born residents \\nof  various  countries.  Although  he  never  physically  saw  or  met  the  women,  except  by \\ntelephone, photographs, or videos, he did send them various sums of money, estimated \\nto  be  a  total  in  excess  of  $60,000,  allegedly  earmarked  by  the  recipients  for \\ntransportation,  medical  care,  support,  and  release \\nfrom  a  customs.  Applicant \\nacknowledged that some of the women were taking advantage of him in scams, but he \\nwas not aware of the truth until later. He denied having a bond of affection, loyalty, or \\nfriendship  obligation  for  any  of  the  foreign  nationals  with  whom  he  had  the \\naforementioned “relationships.”   \\n\\nApplicant’s online dating and gaming forays with foreign women ceased in 2011 \\nwhen  he  met  the  woman  who  eventually  became  his  second  wife.  The  security \\nsignificance  of  these  identified  conditions  requires  further  examination  of  Applicant’s \\nformer  foreign  “relationships”  to  determine  the  degree  of  “heightened  risk”  or  potential \\nconflict  of  interest.  Furthermore,  Department  Counsel  argued  that  Applicant’s  actions \\nrevealed  cloudy  judgment,  a  lack  of  self-discipline,  and  a  vulnerability    to  possible \\nmanipulation and exploitation.  The SOR alleged that Applicant wired money to various \\noversea  locations  “in  an  attempt  to  incite  the  relationships.”  (Emphasis  added).40  The \\nevidence  is  persuasive  that,  after  nearly  three  decades  of  marriage  and  a  separation \\nand pending divorce, Applicant was active in online dating and simply wished to make \\nthe right social connection with a female. Nevertheless, AG ¶¶ 7(a) and 7(e) are partially \\nestablished. \\n\\nThe  guideline  also  includes  examples  of  conditions  that  could  mitigate  security \\nconcerns  arising  from  foreign  influence.  Under  AG  ¶  8(a),  the  disqualifying  condition \\nmay be mitigated where: \\n\\n                                                           \\n\\n40  It  is  unclear  why  the  word  “incite”  was  used  in  the  SOR  for  that  word  generally  conveys  a  negative \\nimplication, such as to stir up, fan the flames of, provoke, inflame, egg on, whip up, or foment. The evidence seems to \\ninfer another meaning such as encourage, kindle, arouse, or stimulate.  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n12 \\n\\n                                      \\n \\n\\n\n",

One  such  factor  is  the  potential  for  pressure,  coercion, \\nexploitation,  or  duress.  In  that  regard,  it  is  important  to  realize  that  Applicant  never \\nintended to, and did not, leave the U.S. to enter any of the foreign countries, and that \\nhis  sole  intent  was  to  have  individuals  travel  to  the  U.S.  for  brief  visits  to  explore \\npossible continuing relationships. In fact, none of those foreign women ever entered the \\nU.S., and their sole purpose was seemingly to scam money from Applicant. Yes, he did \\nsend the women substantial sums of money, but any “relationships” that he might have \\ndeveloped with them ceased in 2010 or 2011, at least four years before the SOR was \\nissued.  In  those  circumstances,  there  is  very  little  potential  for  pressure,  coercion, \\nexploitation, or duress.  \\n\\n \\nApplicant’s  immediate  family  and  extended  family  still  reside  in  the  U.S.,  and \\nthose  foreign  women  still  remain  overseas  without  any  continuing  contact  with \\nApplicant.

While  Applicant  may  have  been  somewhat  naive,  and  displayed  a  lack  of \\njudgment, in falling for scams and sending such large sums of money to strangers, I am \\npersuaded that Applicant’s loyalty to the United States is steadfast and undivided, and \\nthat he has “such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that [he] \\ncan be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.” AG ¶¶ \\n8(a), 8(b), and 8(f) apply. \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n13 \\n\\n                                      \\n \\n\\n\n",

The hearing was held as scheduled on February 22, 2016.  \\n\\n \\nAt the hearing, Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through \\n7,  while  Applicant  testified  and  offered  no  exhibits.  After  the  hearing,  he  submitted \\ndocuments that were marked as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through F. All exhibits were \\nadmitted  into  evidence  without  objection.  The  transcript  (Tr.)  of  the  hearing  was \\nreceived on March 1, 2016. \\n\\nProcedural Matter \\n\\n \\nDepartment Counsel moved to amend SOR ¶ 1.c by changing the listed month \\nfrom  May  to  April.  Applicant  had  no  objection  to  the  amendment.  The  motion  was \\ngranted.1 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nFindings of Fact \\n\\n \\nApplicant is a 33-year-old security guard who is being sponsored for a security \\nclearance  by  a  federal  contractor.  He  first  began  working  for  that  contractor  in  about \\nFebruary  2010,  but  subsequently  has  been  employed  by  other  companies.  He \\ngraduated  from  high  school  in  2002,  attended  college  without  earning  a  degree,  and \\nqualified as an emergency medical technician (EMT). From 2002 to 2008, he served in \\nthe  Army  National  Guard,  achieved  the  grade  of  specialist  (E-4),  and  received  an \\nhonorable discharge. He deployed to Iraq from January 2007 to February 2008. He is \\ndivorced  and  has  a  child  who  is  nine  years  old.  He  was  first  granted  a  security \\nclearance in 2004.2 \\n \\n\\nThe  SOR  alleged  under  Guideline  K  that  Applicant  committed  three  security \\nviolations in 2010 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.c). Under Guideline E, the SOR alleged the he was \\ncharged with assault on a family member in 2009 (SOR ¶ 2.a); that he was terminated \\nfrom a job during a probationary period in 2009 (SOR ¶ 2.b); that he was counseled for \\nneglect of duty and falsification in 2009 (SOR ¶ 2.c); that he illegally gained access to a \\nhotel in 2009 (SOR ¶ 2.d); that he was returned early from an overseas assignment and \\nplaced  on  probation  in  2010  (SOR  2.e);  and  that  he  falsified  his  responses  to  two \\nquestions in an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) (SOR ¶¶ \\n2.f and 2.g). The allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.c were also cross-alleged under Guideline \\nE in a single allegation (SOR ¶ 2.h). In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the \\nallegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.c, and 2.a-2.e, did not respond to the allegation in SOR ¶ \\n2.h, and denied the remaining allegations.3 \\n \\n                                                           \\n\\n1 Tr. 10-11, 42. \\n\\n2 Tr. 5-6, 62, 65, 92-93, 102-104; GE 1, 2. \\n\\n3 Applicant’s Answer to the SOR. \\n\\n \\n2 \\n \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.c,  2.e,  and  2.h  –  three  security  violations  in  a  two-month \\nperiod,  being  returned  from  an  overseas  assignment  without  completing  a \\ncontract,  and  being  placed  on  probation  in  2010.  From  March  to  April  2010, \\nApplicant worked as a security guard for a company [hereafter referred to as “Company \\nA”]  at  an  overseas  location.  In  that  job,  his  duties  included  verifying  the  eligibility  of \\nthose seeking access to controlled spaces and classified information. \\n\\n \\nOn March 1, 2010, a team leader at Company A issued a memorandum for the \\nrecord (MFR) that reflected Applicant closed, but did not lock, a safe in a secured space \\nand failed to record properly the opening and closing of the safe and the logging in and \\nout of classified documents. (Allegation in SOR 1.a). Applicant was counseled to ensure \\nthat  all  procedures  were  followed,  especially  those  concerning  the  safeguarding  of \\nclassified \\ninstances  of  unsatisfactory \\nperformance  would  result  in  more  severe  corrective  action.  The  MFR  reflected  it  was \\nplaced in “personnel file,” but it does not contain Applicant’s signature or any indication \\nthat he was shown it or informed about it.4 \\n\\ninformation,  and  admonished \\n\\nthat \\n\\nfurther \\n\\n \\nApplicant testified that he never willfully violated any security protocol that was \\nproperly  explained  to  him.  This  incident  occurred  soon  after  he  began  working  for \\nCompany A. He arrived at the overseas location less than 48 hours before the incident. \\nIt happened his first day on the job. He claimed that he was not given proper guidance \\non the opening and closing of the safe. The safe was not secure because he failed to \\nspin the lock dial. The safe was located in a secure room and the classified information \\nwas not subject to compromise. Additionally, a person cleared for classified information \\nsigned out a document, but Applicant did not know there was a part of the document \\nthat he was required to fill out. He acknowledged that he made mistakes because he did \\nnot ask enough questions and stated he did not thereafter make those same mistakes \\nagain.5 \\n \\nOn March 10, 2010, a team leader at Company A issued a MFR that reflected \\nApplicant failed to follow orders by permitting a non-cleared worker to have access to \\nthe controlled access area (CAA) without verifying the worker was on the CAA access \\nroster. (Allegation in SOR ¶ 1.b). Applicant was questioned about this security violation \\nand  stated  that  he  recognized  the  worker.  The  MFR  noted  that  the  worker  had  just \\nreturned from a leave of absence and had not yet been placed back on the CAA access \\nroster.  The  MFR  also  indicated  that  it  would  serve  as  a  written  reprimand  of \\nunsatisfactory performance. The MFR reflected it was placed in “personnel file,” but it \\ndoes  not  contain  Applicant’s  signature  or  any  indication  that  he  was  shown  it  or \\ninformed about it.6 \\n                                                           \\n\\n4 GE 2, 3. \\n\\n5 Tr. 13, 21-34, 41; GE 2; Applicant’s Answer to the SOR. \\n\\n6 GE 2, 4. Interestingly, the text of the MFR issued on April 19, 2010, referred to an incident that \\n\\noccurred on May 17-18, 2010. An email attached to the MFR corrected those dates to April 17-18, 2010. \\n\\n \\n3 \\n \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "Applicant testified that this was his second day working at a particular post. He \\nstated  that  he  read  the  wrong  weekly  CAA  access  roster  at  the  post  and  the  non-\\ncleared worker was listed on that roster. This was an outdated access roster. Applicant \\nclaimed  that,  due  to  a  clerical  error,  the  individual  was  not  added  to  the  most  recent \\naccess roster. He claimed he recognized the individual as being a person on the access \\nroster from the previous day, but that was the wrong access roster. When the error was \\ndiscovered,  the  old  roster  was  taken  away  and  a  new  roster  was  issued  with  the \\nindividual in question added to it. Applicant stated his team leader  was upset that he \\nhad not checked the latest access roster. He was counseled for this incident, but did not \\nremember receiving a written warning at that time.7 \\n\\n \\nOn  April  19,  2010,  a  team  leader  at  Company  A  issued  a  MFR  that  reflected \\nApplicant failed to conduct properly a page inventory of classified documents on April \\n17,  2010.  (Allegation  in  SOR  ¶  1.c).  The  MFR  noted  that  two  of  the  documents  had \\nbeen  previously  combined  and  another  had  48  pages  removed  for  destruction. \\nApplicant’s  inventory  failed  to  account  for  the  missing  pages.  He  was  asked  how  he \\nconducted the inventory and responded by saying he conducted a page-by-page count. \\nWhen asked to explain the discrepancy involving the missing pages, he acknowledged \\nhis mistake. The MFR reflected it was placed in “personnel file,” but it does not contain \\nApplicant’s signature or any indication that he was shown it or informed about it.8 \\n\\n \\n \\nIn his background interview, Applicant stated that he counted the pages. At the \\nhearing, he testified that every week a  document inventory was conducted and every \\nmonth a more extensive page-by-page document inventory was conducted. He stated \\nthat he made the mistake of believing this inventory was the weekly document inventory \\ninstead  of  the  monthly  page-by-page  inventory.  He  claimed  the  team  leader  had \\nimproperly taken the missing pages and stored them in his room without logging them \\nout.  He  believed  the  team  leader  was  setting  a  trap  for  the  guard  conducting  the \\ninventory.  This  incident  resulted  in  a  conflict  between  him  and  the  team  leader.  He \\ncontacted the program manager and reported that the team leader improperly handled \\ndocuments. He also indicated that he wrote a detailed rebuttal to the counseling.9 \\n \\n \\nShortly after the incident on April 17, 2010, Applicant was sent home before the \\ncompletion  of  his  contract.  A  payroll  document  reflected  “[h]e  is  on  probation.  Please \\nhold  pay.”  (Allegation  in  SOR  ¶  2.e).  He  stated  that  he  received  all  of  the  written \\nwarnings/reprimands when he was leaving this overseas location. He further stated that \\nhe was so upset about being sent home that he did not read the documents that were \\ngiven to him. He did not consider his return to the United States as a termination. His \\nprogram  manager  led  him  believe  that  he  was  sent  back  because  of  the  personality \\n                                                           \\n\\n7 Tr. 34-42; GE 2; Applicant’s Answer to the SOR. \\n\\n8 GE 2, 5.

This is \\nalso the company that is currently sponsoring Applicant for a security clearance.10 \\n \\nSOR ¶ 2.a – charged with assault on family member in 2009. On January 9, \\n \\n2009, Applicant was issued a summons to appear in court for the charge of assault on a \\nfamily member, a Class 1 misdemeanor. On April 28, 2009, Applicant pleaded not guilty \\nto the charge. The court found there were sufficient facts to establish guilt but deferred \\nadjudication  for  one  year.  He  was  required to attend anger-management  classes  and \\navoid committing any offenses. In April 2011, the charge was dismissed.11 \\n \\n \\nIn  his  e-QIP,  Applicant  disclosed  this  charge.  He  testified  that  his  ex-wife  was \\nstriking him during an argument. He tried to block her hands but accidently hit her on \\nthe side of the head with an open hand. He testified that he never hit his ex-wife before \\nor after that incident.12 \\n \\n\\nSOR ¶ 2.b – termination from a job during a probationary period in March \\n2009.  In  his  e-QIP,  Applicant  disclosed  that  he  was  terminated  from  a  security  guard \\nposition with Company B near the end of a six-month probationary period. Company B \\nwas  not  required  to  provide  an  explanation  for  the  termination  during  that  period.  He \\nnoted that he was accused of wearing an earbud linked to an unauthorized MP3 player \\nwhile at work. He stated the earbud was for a cell phone that was permitted. He also \\nindicated  that  this  incident  happened  about  a  month  before  his  probationary  period \\nended, and he was never written up for this incident.13  \\n\\n \\nApplicant testified that he believed that he was terminated from the probationary \\nposition because of the pending domestic-violence charge. If he was convicted of the \\ncharge, he would have been prohibited from carrying a firearm at work. If he continued \\nto  work  for  Company  B  beyond  the  probationary  period,  he  would  have  become  a \\nmember of the employee’s union and the company would have had to hire an attorney \\nto  remove  him  from  the  job  if  he  could  no  longer  carry  a  firearm.    He  indicated  the \\nemployer was willing to rehire him after the domestic-violence charge was dismissed.14  \\n\\n \\nSOR  ¶  2.c  –  counseled  for  neglect  of  duty  and  falsification  in  September \\n2009.

       "interview,  he  voluntarily  provided  a  copy  of  the  official  counseling  he  received  on \\nSeptember 7, 2009, for this incident.15 \\n\\n \\nApplicant testified that the night shift consisted of two guards who manned two \\nposts. Usually the guards would rotate between the posts each night. On the night in \\nquestion, however, the schedule did not rotate the guards between the posts. Applicant \\nand  the  other  guard  assumed  their  assignments  were  rotated  and  stood  them  in  that \\nmanner. In doing so, they signed the logs for the wrong posts. He claimed no dereliction \\nof duty occurred because both posts were properly manned. The other guard also was \\nwritten up for this discrepancy.16 \\n\\n \\nSOR ¶ 2.d – illegally gained access to hotel by opening a sliding door in \\n2009. While working for Company C overseas from July to December 2009, Applicant \\nresided in a hotel. The hotel was connected to a mall. There was a sliding door from the \\nmall  to  the  hotel.  After  a  certain  time  each  night,  the  door  was  secured.  On  two \\noccasions, Applicant went through the sliding door after it was secured. He claimed that \\nhe was given permission from the guard in the mall to use the door on both occasions. \\nAfter the second occasion, the hotel management was upset and threatened to kick out \\nall of the U.S. contractors from the hotel. Company C agreed to send Applicant back to \\nthe United States to appease the hotel. He acknowledged that he was given a written \\nwarning because of this incident. He also stated that he did not consider it a termination \\nbecause he was told it was not his fault and the company would find him another job. \\nHe met with a company representative for another job opportunity overseas, but soon \\nthereafter his father passed away and his mother was in the hospital, which precluded \\nhim  from  taking  that  job.  In  his  e-QIP,  he  did  not  list  the  reason  for  termination  of \\nemployment with Company C.

       "The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \\naccess  to  classified  information.  This  relationship  transcends  normal  duty  hours  and \\nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \\npossible  risk  that  the  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  safeguard \\nclassified  information.  Such  decisions  entail  a  certain  degree  of  legally  permissible \\nextrapolation  of  potential,  rather  than  actual,  risk  of  compromise  of  classified \\ninformation. Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in \\nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. \\nOr.  10865  §  7.  See  also  Executive  Order  12968  (Aug.  2,  1995),  Section  3.  Thus,  a \\nclearance  decision  is  merely  an  indication  that  the  Applicant  has  or  has  not  met  the \\nstrict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing \\na clearance. \\n\\n \\nInitially,  the  Government  must  establish,  by  substantial  evidence,  conditions  in \\nthe  personal  or  professional  history  of  the  applicant  that  may  disqualify  the  applicant \\nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \\nof  establishing  controverted  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  See  Egan,  484  U.S.  at  531.  \\n“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. \\nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \\npresume  a  nexus  or  rational  connection  between  proven  conduct  under  any  of  the \\ncriteria listed and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \\n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \\n\\n \\nOnce  the  Government  establishes  a  disqualifying  condition  by  substantial \\nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \\nfacts.

       "(g) any failure to comply with rules for the protection of classified or other \\nsensitive information; and  \\n \\n(h)  negligent  or  lax  security  habits  that  persist  despite  counseling  by \\nmanagement.  \\n \\n \\nIn early 2010, Applicant committed a number of security violations that resulted in \\nhim  being  issued  written  warnings  and  being  returned  early  from  an  overseas \\nassignment. AG ¶¶ 34(g) and 34(h) apply. \\n \\n \\n¶ 35: \\n \\n\\nThere are three handling of protected information mitigating conditions under AG \\n\\n(a)  so  much  time  has  elapsed  since  the  behavior,  or  it  happened  so \\ninfrequently  or  under  such  unusual  circumstances,  that  it  is  unlikely  to \\nrecur  and  does  not  cast  doubt  on \\nreliability, \\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;  \\n \\n(b) the individual responded favorably to counseling or remedial security \\ntraining and now demonstrates a positive attitude toward the discharge of \\nsecurity responsibilities; and \\n \\n(c)  the security violations were due to improper or inadequate training. \\n\\nindividual’s \\n\\nthe \\n\\n \\n \\nAs  the  Appeal  Board  has  stated,  once  it  is  established  that  an  applicant  has \\ncommitted security violations, he or she has a “very heavy burden” of persuasion as to \\nmitigation.

While Applicant has not \\ncommitted any other security violation since then, this conduct should not be considered \\nin  isolation,  but  should  be  examined  in  relation  to  his  other  questionable  conduct  as \\nalleged under Guideline E. When viewed in  that manner, I am unable to find that his \\nconduct  happened  so  long  ago,  was  so  infrequent,  or  occurred  under  unusual \\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur. In reaching this conclusion, I also considered \\nthat the security violations happened shortly after he started a new job and he claimed \\nhe had not received adequate training. Nevertheless, I find that his security violations \\ncontinue  to  cast  doubt  on  his  reliability,  trustworthiness,  and  good  judgment.

Due \\nto  those  security  violations,  he  was  sent  home  from  an  overseas  location,  placed  on \\nprobation, and was not employed for the intervening six months. It is not believable that \\nhe would have forgotten about those recent events when he submitted his e-QIP at the \\nstart of his next job. His claim that he did not have the records or written warnings with \\nhim  when  he  submitted  the  e-QIP  is  likewise  not  persuasive.  I  find  that  Applicant \\ndeliberately falsified his 2010 e-QIP when he failed to disclose those written warnings \\nand counseling. AG ¶ 16(a) applies.  \\n\\n \\n11 \\n \\n \\n\\n\n",

The  action  was  taken  under  Executive  Order  10865,  Safeguarding \\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \\nDefense  Directive  5220.6,  Defense  Industrial  Personnel  Security  Clearance  Review \\nProgram  (January  2,  1992),  as  amended  (Directive);  and  the  adjudicative  guidelines \\n(AG) effective within the Department of Defense after September 1, 2006.  \\n\\n  \\nOn July 11, 2014, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a decision on the \\n \\nrecord. Department Counsel issued a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on July 7, 2015.  \\nApplicant received the FORM on  August 14, 2015. He had 30 days from his receipt of \\nthe  FORM  to  submit  additional  information  in  response  to  the  FORM.  Applicant \\nrequested  an  extension  until  October  19,  2015,  to  submit  matters  in  response  to  the \\nFORM. His Response to the FORM and attached documents are admitted as Item  12. \\nDepartment  Counsel  had  no  objection  to  Applicant’s  Response  to the  Form.  (Item  13) \\nOn November 5, 2015, the FORM was forwarded to the Hearing Office and assigned to \\nme  on  November  9,  2015.  Based  upon  a  review  of  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and \\ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \\n\\n \\n1 \\n \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "Findings of Fact \\n\\n \\n\\nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admits to all SOR allegations.  (Item 2)    \\n\\n \\n \\n \\nApplicant  is  a  43-year-old  employee  of  a  DOD  contractor  seeking  to  obtain  a \\nsecurity clearance. He has worked for his current employer since July 2011. Previously, \\nhe owned his own construction company from October 2007 to July 2011. He has been \\nmarried and divorced twice. He is currently married to his third wife and has a five-year-\\nold son and a three-year-old daughter. He also has a stepson. (Item 3; Item 12)   \\n\\n \\nOn  July  20,  2011,  Applicant  submitted  an  electronic  questionnaire \\n\\nfor \\ninvestigation  processing  (e-QIP).  (Item  3)  A  subsequent  background  investigation \\nrevealed  Applicant  encountered \\nfinancial  problems.  Specifically,  Applicant  was \\napproximately $95,326 past due on a mortgage (SOR ¶ 1.a: Item 6 at 2; Item 7 at 2); he \\nowed a $654 judgement entered against him in November 2009 on behalf of a hospital \\n(SOR  ¶  1.b:  Item  6  at  1;  Item  7  at  1;  Item  9  at  1);  and  he  filed  for  bankruptcy  under \\nChapter  7  in  June  2010.  The  Chapter  7  bankruptcy  was  converted  to  a  Chapter  13 \\nbankruptcy. (SOR ¶ 1.c: Item 5 at 1; Item 6 at 1; Item 7 at 1; Item 10).   \\n\\n \\nIn  his  response  to  the  SOR,  dated  December  11,  2014,  Applicant  admits  to  all \\nallegations,  but  claims  the  debts  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.b  are  included  in  his \\nbankruptcy.    The  Chapter  13  bankruptcy  repayment  plan  required  him  to  pay  $164 \\npayments over a period of 60 months. Applicant indicated he is timely making payments \\nand will continue to do so until the plan is complete in August 2015. (Item 2 at 6)  \\n\\n \\nIn a response to Interrogatories, dated July 15, 2013, Applicant indicated that he \\nfiled for bankruptcy because of his divorce from his second wife in 2009 and as a result \\nof business deal that went bad. He built seven houses for a contractor and was never \\npaid.  He  believes  one  of  the  creditors  (a  mortgage)  included  in  his  bankruptcy  is  the \\nsame as the mortgage alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a. (Item 4 at 9)  \\n\\n \\nApplicant  received  financial  counseling  as  a  requirement  of  his  bankruptcy \\nprocess.  (Item  4  at  13,  25-29)  In  July  2013,  he  also  completed  a  personal  financial \\nworksheet.  His  net  monthly  income  was  $2,851.  He  had  $2,297  in  total  monthly \\nexpenses. After expenses, he had $554 left over in discretionary income. (Item 4 at 22)  \\n\\n \\nIn his response to the FORM, Applicant provided all of his Chapter 13 bankruptcy \\npaperwork. He completed his payment plan and the Chapter 13 bankruptcy is complete. \\nHe  provided  a  copy  of  the  Discharge  of  Debtor  After  Completion  of  Chapter  13  Plan, \\ndated  September  28,  2015.  He  provided  a  copy  of  his  payment  history.  He  also \\nprovided a portion of a TransUnion credit report which indicates the debt alleged in SOR \\n¶  1.b  was  included  in  the  Chapter  13  bankruptcy.  He  is  still  not  sure  where  the \\nmortgage debt came from. It is no longer on his credit report and his attorney assures \\nhim that it was included in the bankruptcy.

       "He said he has made his share of mistakes, but has done everything he could to \\nrectify  the  situation.    Everything  he  does  is  motivated  by  making  his  children’s  lives \\nbetter.  He  explained  he  became  bankrupt  as  a  result  of  his  previous  job  in  the \\nconstruction  business.  Applicant  built  houses.  His  business  partners  backed  out  when \\nthe real estate business slowed down and left Applicant with thousands of unpaid bills. \\nAt  the  same  time,  his  ex-wife  incurred  some  bills  that  he  could  not  afford  to  repay. \\nApplicant is now able to pay his bills. His pay has increased an additional $8 an hour. \\n(Item 12) \\n   \\n\\nPolicies \\n\\n \\n\\nWhen  evaluating  an  applicant’s  suitability \\n\\n \\nthe \\nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \\nintroductory  explanations  for  each  guideline,  the  adjudicative  guidelines  list  potentially \\ndisqualifying  conditions  and  mitigating  conditions,  which  must  be  considered  when \\ndetermining an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. \\n\\nfor  a  security  clearance, \\n\\n \\nThese  guidelines  are  not  inflexible  rules  of  law.  Instead,  recognizing  the \\ncomplexities  of  human  behavior,  these  guidelines  are  applied  in  conjunction  with  the \\nfactors  listed  in  the  adjudicative  process.  The  administrative  judge’s  overarching \\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 2(c), \\nthe  entire  process  is  a  conscientious  scrutiny  of  a  number  of  variables  known  as  the \\n“whole-person  concept.”  The  administrative  judge  must  consider  all  available,  reliable \\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \\ndecision. \\n\\n \\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) \\nrequires  that  “[a]ny  doubt  concerning  personnel  being  considered  for  access  to \\nclassified  information  will  be  resolved  in  favor  of  national  security.”  In  reaching  this \\ndecision,  I  have  drawn  only  those  conclusions  that  are  reasonable,  logical,  and  based \\non the evidence contained in the record.  \\n\\n \\nUnder  Directive  ¶  E3.1.14,  the  Government  must  present  evidence  to  establish \\ncontroverted  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  Under  Directive  ¶  E3.1.15,  the  applicant  is \\nresponsible  for  presenting  “witnesses  and  other  evidence  to  rebut,  explain,  extenuate, \\nor  mitigate  facts  admitted  by  applicant  or  proven  by  Department  Counsel.  .  .  .”  The \\napplicant  has  the  ultimate  burden  of  persuasion  as  to  obtaining  a  favorable  security \\ndecision.  \\n\\nthe  Government  predicated  upon \\n\\n \\nA  person  who  seeks  access  to  classified  information  enters  into  a  fiduciary \\nrelationship  with \\ntrust  and  confidence.  This \\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \\nGovernment  reposes  a  high  degree  of  trust  and  confidence  in  individuals  to  whom  it \\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \\nthe  possible  risk  the  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  protect  or \\nsafeguard  classified  information.  Such  decisions  entail  a  certain  degree  of  legally \\n\\n \\n3 \\n \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "permissible  extrapolation  as  to  potential,  rather  than  actual,  risk  of  compromise  of \\nclassified information. \\n\\n  \\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of \\nthe  national  interest  and  shall  in  no  sense  be  a  determination  as  to  the  loyalty  of  the \\napplicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \\n \\n\\n \\n\\nAnalysis \\n\\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \\n\\nout in AG & 18:       \\n \\n\\nFailure  or  inability  to  live  within  one=s  means,  satisfy  debts,  and  meet \\nfinancial  obligations  may  indicate  poor  self-control,  lack  of  judgment,  or \\nunwillingness  to  abide  by  rules  and  regulations,  all  of  which  can  raise \\nquestions  about  an  individual=s  reliability,  trustworthiness  and  ability  to \\nprotect  classified \\nfinancially \\noverextended  is  at  risk  of  having  to  engage  in  illegal  acts  to  generate \\nfunds.  \\n\\ninformation.  An \\n\\nindividual  who \\n\\nis \\n\\n \\n\\nThe  guideline  notes  several  disqualifying  conditions  that  could  raise  security \\nconcerns. I find AG &19(a) (an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); and AG &19(c) \\n(a  history  of  not  meeting  financial  obligations)  apply  to  Applicant’s  case.  Applicant \\nencountered  financial  problems  since  2008,  which  resulted  in  a  bankruptcy  filing  in \\n2010.   \\n \\nAn  individual  who  is  financially  irresponsible  may  also  be  irresponsible, \\nunconcerned, or careless in their obligations to protect classified information. Behaving \\nirresponsibly in one aspect of life provides an indication of how a person may behave in \\nother  aspects  of  life.  A  person’s  relationship  with  his  creditors  is  a  private  matter  until \\nevidence  is  uncovered  demonstrating  an  inability  or  unwillingness  to  pay  debts  under \\nagreed  terms.  Absent  evidence  of  strong  extenuating  or  mitigating  circumstances,  an \\napplicant with a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk \\ninconsistent with the holding of a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be \\ndebt free, but is required to manage his finances in such a way as to meet his financial \\nobligations.  \\n\\n \\nThe  Government’s  substantial  evidence  and  Applicant’s  own  admissions  raise \\nsecurity  concerns  under  Guideline  F.  The  burden  shifted  to  Applicant  to  produce \\nevidence  to  rebut,  explain,  extenuate,  or  mitigate  the  security  concerns.  (Directive \\n¶E3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden \\nof  disproving  it  never  shifts  to  the  Government.  (See  ISCR  Case  No.  02-31154  at  5 \\n(App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005))  \\n\\n \\n4 \\n \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "The  guideline  also  includes  examples  of  conditions  that  could  mitigate  security \\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions potentially \\napply:  \\n \\nAG  &  20(a)  (the  behavior  happened  so  long  ago,  was  so  infrequent,  or \\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \\ncast  doubt  on  the  individual’s  current  reliability,  trustworthiness,  or  good \\njudgment);  \\n \\nAG  &  20(b)  (the  conditions  that  resulted  in  the  financial  problem  were \\nlargely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \\ndownturn,  unexpected  medical  emergency,  or  a  death,  divorce  or \\nseparation),  and \\nthe \\ncircumstances);  \\n \\nAG  ¶  20(c)  (the  person  has  received  or  is  receiving  counseling  for  the \\nproblem  and/or  there  are  clear  indications  that  the  problem  is  being \\nresolved or is under control);  \\n\\nresponsibly  under \\n\\nthe \\n\\nindividual  acted \\n\\n  \\n\\nAG  &  20(d)  (the  individual  initiated  a  good-faith  effort  to  repay  overdue \\ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts); and   \\n\\n \\n\\nAG &20(e) (the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \\nof  the  past-due  debt  which  is  the  cause  of  the  problem  and  provides \\ndocumented  proof  to  substantiate  the  basis  of  the  dispute  or  provides \\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue). \\n \\nApplicant’s  financial  problems  were  caused  by  a  business  downturn  and \\nexpenses  related  to  his  divorce  from  his  second  wife  in  2009.  His  business  partners \\nbroke their agreements with Applicant during the real estate downturn, leaving Applicant \\nwith thousands of unpaid bills. He attempted to resolve the situation on his own until he \\ndetermined  he  had  no  option  other  than  bankruptcy.  He  successfully  completed  his \\npayment plan under Chapter 13 and his debts were discharged in September 2015. His \\nsalary  has  increased  an  additional  $8  per  hour  and  he  is  able  to  pay  his  bills.  His \\nfinancial  problems  are  unlikely  to  recur  and  no  longer  cast  doubt  on  his  reliability, \\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. AG ¶¶ 20(a) and 20(b) apply.  \\n\\n \\nAG & 20(c) applies. Applicant was required to attend financial counseling as part \\nof  his  bankruptcy.    He  completed  financial  counseling  as  well  as  the  terms  of  his \\nChapter 13 repayment plan. Applicant’s financial situation is now under control.  \\n\\n \\nAG & 20(d) applies because Applicant demonstrated he made a good-faith effort \\ntowards  resolving  his  delinquent  accounts.    He  completed  his  Chapter  13  repayment \\nplan.  All  payments  were  made  on  a  timely  basis.    AG  &  20(e)  is  applicable  because \\nApplicant disputed the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b, claiming they were part of \\n\\n \\n5 \\n \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "his  bankruptcy.  The  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.b  was  verified  to  be  a  part  of  his \\nbankruptcy. The mortgage debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a is no longer on his credit report.  \\n\\n \\nApplicant  resolved  any  doubts  raised  by  his  financial  situation.  He  successfully  \\n\\ndemonstrated that his financial situation is under control.  \\n \\nWhole-Person Concept \\n \\n \\nUnder  the  whole-person  concept,  the  administrative  judge  must  evaluate  an \\napplicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s \\nconduct  and  all  the  circumstances.  The  administrative  judge  should  consider  the  nine \\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  \\n \\n\\nthe  conduct, \\n\\nis  voluntary;  (6) \\n\\nthe  nature,  extent,  and  seriousness  of \\nto \\n\\nthe  conduct;  (2) \\nthe \\n(1) \\ninclude  knowledgeable \\ncircumstances  surrounding \\nparticipation;  (3)  the  frequency  and  recency  of  the  conduct;  (4)  the \\nindividual’s  age  and maturity  at  the  time  of the  conduct;  (5)  the  extent to \\nwhich  participation \\nthe  presence  or  absence  of \\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \\nfor  the  conduct;  (8)  the  potential  for  pressure,  coercion,  exploitation,  or \\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \\n \\n \\nUnder  AG  ¶  2(c),  the  ultimate  determination  of  whether  to  grant  eligibility  for  a \\nsecurity  clearance  must  be  an  overall  commonsense  judgment  based  upon  careful \\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \\n        \\n\\nI  considered  the  potentially  disqualifying  and  mitigating  conditions  in  light  of  all \\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered several circumstances \\nbeyond  Applicant’s  control  adversely  affected  his  finances,  including  divorce  and  the \\nreal estate downturn that adversely affected his construction business. He successfully \\ncompleted  his  Chapter  13  repayment  plan  and  his  financial  situation  has  stabilized. \\nApplicant mitigated the security concerns raised under financial considerations.  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \\n\\n \\n\\nFormal Findings \\n\\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \\n\\nSubparagraphs 1.a – 1.c:   \\n\\nFor Applicant \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nFOR APPLICANT \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n6 \\n \\n \\n\\n\n",

He has a history of \\nfinancial  delinquencies,  including  delinquent  debts  owed  to  eight  creditors  in  the \\napproximate  amount  of  $37,847.  While  Applicant  has  either  resolved  or  is  making \\npayments  on  five  of  his  debts,  he  failed  to  establish  that  three  others  are  being \\naddressed. Applicant has  not mitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns \\nbecause he has failed to show he  acted responsibly with respect to  these outstanding \\ndebts. He mitigated the Foreign Influence security concerns created by his mother, two \\nsisters, and three brothers, who are all citizens and residents of Vietnam. Eligibility for \\naccess to classified information is denied.  \\n \\n\\nStatement of the Case \\n\\n \\n\\nOn  December  5,  2014,  the  Defense  Office  of  Hearings  and  Appeals  (DOHA) \\nissued  a  Statement  of  Reasons  (SOR)  to  Applicant  detailing  security  concerns  under \\nGuideline  F,  Financial  Considerations  and  Guideline  B,  Foreign  Influence.  The  action \\nwas  taken  under  Executive  Order  (EO)  10865,  Safeguarding  Classified  Information \\nwithin  Industry  (February  20,  1960),  as  amended;  Department  of  Defense  Directive \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n1 \\n\\n\n",
       "5220.6,  Defense  Industrial  Personnel  Security  Clearance  Review Program  (January  2, \\n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective for cases \\nafter September 1, 2006. (Item 1.) \\n\\n \\nApplicant responded to the SOR (Answer) on January 11, 2015 and February 2, \\n \\n2015. (Item 1.) He requested that his case be decided by an administrative judge on the \\nwritten  record.  Department  Counsel  submitted  the  Government’s  written  case  on  April \\n21,  2016.  A  complete  copy  of  the  File  of  Relevant  Material  (FORM),  containing  five \\nItems, was received by Applicant on April 27, 2016. He was afforded an opportunity to \\nfile objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation within 30 days \\nof  his  receipt of  the  FORM.  Applicant  submitted documents  marked  Applicant  Exhibits \\n(AE) A through K in response to the FORM within the 30-day period that ended May 27, \\n2016.  Department  Counsel  had  no  objection  to  AE  A  through  AE  K,  and  they  are \\nadmitted into the record. DOHA assigned the case to me on December 13, 2016.  \\n \\n\\nProcedural Rulings \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nIn  the  FORM,  the  Government  requested  I  take  administrative  notice  of  certain \\nfacts  relating  to  Vietnam.  Department  Counsel  provided  a  five-page  summary  of  the \\nfacts,  supported  by  five  Government  documents  pertaining  to  Vietnam,  identified  as \\nItem  6.  The  documents  provide  elaboration  and  context  for  the  summary.  I  take \\nadministrative  notice  of  the  facts  included  in  the  U.S.  Government  reports.  They  are \\nlimited to matters of general knowledge, not subject to reasonable dispute. They are set \\nout in the Findings of Fact. \\n\\n \\n\\nFindings of Fact \\n\\n \\n \\nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations in subparagraphs 2.a and 2.b. He failed \\nto explicitly admit or deny SOR subparagraph 1.a through 1.h, and as a result, they will \\nbe treated as denials. (Item 1.) After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, and \\nexhibits, I make the following findings of fact. \\n \\n \\nApplicant is 51 years old. He was born in Vietnam and immigrated to the United \\nStates. He attended a U.S. high school. He became a U.S. citizen in 1981.  He earned \\nan  associate’s  degree  in  1984  from  a  U.S.  college.  He  was  employed  by  a  federal \\ncontractor from February 2011 until he was laid off in February 2013. He is married to a \\nU.S. citizen, and has two children who are U. S. citizens. (Item 2.) \\n \\n \\napproximate amount of $37,847. His debts are as follows. \\n \\n \\nApplicant  is  delinquent  on  his  $257,199  primary  mortgage  in  the  amount  of \\n$10,420,  as  alleged  in  SOR  subparagraph  1.a.  He  presented  documentation  showing \\nhe made payments of $2,085 to this creditor on December 26, 2014, January 20, 2015, \\nand  May  14,  2016.  He  indicated  in  a  letter  that  he  was  trying  to  bring  this  account \\ncurrent. However, he failed to establish a regular payment history and document that he \\nbrought this debt current. It remains unresolved. (Item 1; AE A; AE B.) \\n\\nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleges Applicant is indebted to eight creditors in the \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n2 \\n\\n\n",
       "Applicant  was  delinquent  on  a  $17,986  second  mortgage  in  the  amount  of \\n \\n$2,295, as  alleged  in SOR  subparagraph 1.b.  He  presented a  letter  from this  creditor, \\ndated March 15, 2015, which reflected this debt was paid in full on March 11, 2016. It is \\nresolved. (Item 1; AE C.) \\n \\n \\nApplicant was indebted on a charged-off credit card in the amount of $20,632, as \\nalleged in SOR subparagraph 1.c. He presented a letter from this creditor, dated March \\n9, 2013, which reflected this debt was paid in full. It is resolved. (Item 1; AE D.) \\n \\n \\nApplicant was delinquent on an $11,935  vehicle loan in the amount of $618, as \\nalleged in SOR subparagraph 1.d. Applicant presented a copy of a receipt for a check in \\nthe  amount  of  $710,  dated  April  29,  2016,  and  an  account  statement  that  shows \\nApplicant’s loan was current as of March 30, 2016, with an unpaid balance of $7,422.50 \\nremaining on the loan. Applicant is current on this debt. (Item 1; AE E; AE F.)  \\n \\n \\nApplicant  is  indebted  on  a  charged-off  account  in  the  amount  of  $2,654,  as \\nalleged in SOR subparagraph 1.e. He produced a written payment agreement with this \\ncreditor,  which  shows  he  agreed  to  make  monthly  payments  of  $100.  He  produced \\ndocumentation that shows he made one $100 payment on May 14, 2016.  This debt is \\nbeing resolved. (AE H.) \\n \\n \\nApplicant is indebted on a charged-off account in the amount of $530, as alleged \\nin SOR subparagraph 1.f. Applicant produced no documentation that corresponds with \\nthis account. It is unresolved. (Item 5.) \\n \\nApplicant is indebted on a charged-off account in the amount of $409, as alleged \\n \\nin  SOR  subparagraph  1.g.  Applicant  produced  a  letter  from  a  collection  agent  on  this \\naccount, which offered to settle this debt for a payment of $229.06. He failed to produce \\ndocumentation  to  show  he  made  any  payments  to  the  creditor  under  this  agreement. \\n(AE K.)  \\n \\n \\nApplicant  was  indebted  on  a  charged-off  account  in  the  amount  of  $289,  as \\nalleged  in  SOR  subparagraph  1.h.  Applicant  presented  a  receipt  dated  May  20,  2016, \\nwhich shows Applicant paid this debt. It is resolved. (AE J.) \\n \\n \\nApplicant  attributed  his  delinquencies  to  a  reduction  of  hours  at  his  previous \\nemployer, his wife’s unemployment, and his current unemployment. He also noted that \\nhe was aiding his daughter with her university expenses. (AE A.) Applicant provided no \\nrecent household budget showing monthly household expenses, although an April 2013 \\npersonal financial statement showed his expenses exceeded his income by more than \\n$1,000 per month. (Item 3.) He did not provide a copy of his current earnings statement. \\nWithout updated information, I am unable to assess his current financial status, and his \\nability  or  willingness  to  repay  his  remaining  delinquent  debt  and  avoid  future \\ndelinquencies. The record lacks any evidence of credit or financial counseling.  \\n \\n \\nUnder  Guideline  B,  the  SOR  alleges  Applicant’s  mother,  two  sisters,  and  three \\nbrothers  are  citizens  and  residents  of  Vietnam.  Applicant’s  mother  is  unemployed.  He \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n3 \\n\\n\n",
       "communicates  with  her  on  a  monthly  basis  by  phone  and  sees  her  yearly,  when  she \\nvisits  the  United  States.  One  of  Applicant’s  sisters  is  a  waitress,  and  the  other  is  a \\nconstruction  helper.  Applicant’s  brothers  are  unemployed.  Applicant  has  not  seen  his \\nsiblings  in  person  since  1997.  He  communicates  with  them  approximately  once  per \\nmonth.  None  of  his  relatives  in  Vietnam  is  employed  by  the  Vietnamese  government. \\nHis family members in Vietnam are not aware he has applied for a security clearance. \\n(Item 3.)  \\n \\n \\nVietnam is an authoritarian state ruled by the Communist Party of Vietnam. The \\nVietnamese Government arbitrarily arrests and detains individuals for political activities. \\nThe  Government  limits  freedom  of  speech,  religion,  and  the  press.  U.S.  citizens  have \\nbeen detained after traveling in the area of closed borders with China, Cambodia, and \\nLaos.  By  Vietnamese  law,  anyone  born  to  at  least  one  Vietnamese-citizen  parent  is \\nconsidered to be a Vietnamese citizen. (Item 6.) \\n \\n\\nPolicies \\n\\n \\n\\nWhen  evaluating  an  applicant’s  suitability \\n\\n \\nthe \\nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \\nintroductory  explanations  for  each  guideline,  the  adjudicative  guidelines  list  potentially \\ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \\napplicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. \\n \\n\\nfor  a  security  clearance, \\n\\nThese  guidelines  are  not  inflexible  rules  of  law.  Instead,  recognizing  the \\ncomplexities  of  human  behavior,  administrative  judges  apply  the  guidelines  in \\nconjunction with the factors listed in AG ¶ 2(a), describing the adjudicative process. The \\nadministrative \\nimpartial,  and \\ncommonsense  decision.  According  to  AG  ¶ 2(c),  the  entire  process  is  a  conscientious \\nscrutiny  of  a  number  of  variables  known  as  the  “whole-person  concept.”  The \\nadministrative  judge  must  consider  all  available,  reliable  information  about  the  person, \\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \\n\\njudge’s  overarching  adjudicative  goal \\n\\nis  a \\n\\nfair, \\n\\n \\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) \\nrequires  that  “[a]ny  doubt  concerning  personnel  being  considered  for  access  to \\nclassified  information  will  be  resolved  in  favor  of  national  security.”  In  reaching  this \\ndecision,  I  have  drawn  only  those  conclusions  that  are  reasonable,  logical,  and  based \\non the evidence contained in the record.  \\n\\n \\nUnder  Directive  ¶  E3.1.14,  the  Government  must  present  evidence  to  establish \\ncontroverted  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  Under  Directive  ¶  E3.1.15,  the  applicant  is \\nresponsible  for  presenting  “witnesses  and  other  evidence  to  rebut,  explain,  extenuate, \\nor  mitigate  facts  admitted  by  the  applicant  or  proven  by  Department  Counsel.”  The \\napplicant  has  the  ultimate  burden  of  persuasion  to  obtain  a  favorable  clearance \\ndecision.  \\n\\n \\nA  person  who  seeks  access  to  classified  information  enters  into  a  fiduciary \\ntrust  and  confidence.  This \\n\\nthe  Government  predicated  upon \\n\\n \\nrelationship  with \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n4 \\n\\n\n",
       "relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \\nGovernment  reposes  a  high  degree  of  trust  and  confidence  in  individuals  to  whom  it \\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \\nthe  possible  risk  the  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  protect  or \\nsafeguard  classified  information.  Such  decisions  entail  a  certain  degree  of  legally \\npermissible  extrapolation  as  to  potential,  rather  than  actual,  risk  of  compromise  of \\nclassified information. \\n \\n\\nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be “in terms of the \\nnational  interest  and  shall  in  no  sense  be  a  determination  as  to  the  loyalty  of  the \\napplicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \\n \\n\\nAnalysis \\n\\nThe  security  concern  for  Financial  Considerations  is  set  out  in  AG  ¶  18,  as \\n\\nfollows:       \\n \\n\\nFailure  or  inability  to  live  within  one’s  means,  satisfy  debts,  and  meet \\nfinancial  obligations  may  indicate  poor  self-control,  lack  of  judgment,  or \\nunwillingness  to  abide  by  rules  and  regulations,  all  of  which  can  raise \\nquestions  about  an  individual’s  reliability,  trustworthiness  and  ability  to \\nprotect  classified \\nfinancially \\noverextended  is  at  risk  of  having  to  engage  in  illegal  acts  to  generate \\nfunds.  \\n \\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise a security concern under \\n\\ninformation.  An \\n\\nindividual  who \\n\\nis \\n\\nAG ¶ 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \\n \\n\\n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \\n \\n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \\n\\n \\n \\nApplicant  had  a  history  of  financial  delinquencies  that  he  had  been  unable  to \\nresolve,  including  delinquent  debts  to  eight  creditors  in  the  approximate  amount  of \\n$37,847,  as  alleged  in  the  SOR.  The  Government  established  the  disqualifying \\nconditions in AG ¶ 19(a) and 19(c). Further inquiry about the applicability of mitigating \\nconditions is required.  \\n \\n \\napplicable:  \\n\\nFive Financial Considerations mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially \\n\\n \\n(a)  the  behavior  happened  so  long  ago,  was  so  infrequent,  or  occurred \\nunder  such  circumstances  that  it  is  unlikely  to  recur  and  does  not  cast \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n5 \\n\\n\n",
       "is \\n\\nthe  cause  of \\n\\ndoubt  on  the  individual’s  current  reliability,  trustworthiness,  or  good \\njudgment; \\n \\n(b)  the  conditions  that  resulted  in  the  financial  problem  were  largely \\nbeyond  the  person’s  control  (e.g.,  loss  of  employment,  a  business \\ndownturn,  unexpected  medical  emergency,  or  a  death,  divorce  or \\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \\n \\n(c)  the  person  has  received  or  is  receiving  counseling  for  the  problem \\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \\nunder control;  \\n \\n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \\notherwise resolve debts; and \\n \\n(e)  the  individual  has  a  reasonable  basis  to  dispute  the  legitimacy  of  the \\npast-due  debt  which \\nthe  problem  and  provides \\ndocumented  proof  to  substantiate  the  basis  of  the  dispute  or  provides \\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \\n \\n \\nApplicant has not acted responsibly, or in a timely manner, to attempt to resolve \\nhis remaining delinquent debt. His debt is current and on-going as demonstrated by the \\nunresolved debts in SOR subparagraphs 1.a, 1.f, and 1.g. Applicant’s conduct does not \\nwarrant application of AG ¶ 20(a).  \\n \\nApplicant’s debts, which were identified in the SOR, may have been due, in part, \\n \\nto his unemployment and underemployment and his wife’s unemployment. However, he \\nalso  made  the  decision  to  pay  for  his  daughter’s  university  education,  instead  of  his \\nprimary  mortgage  and  other  debts.

       "The  security  concern  relating  to  the  guideline for  Foreign  Influence  is  set  out  in \\n\\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \\n \\n \\nAG ¶ 6: \\n \\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \\nany  foreign  interest.  Adjudication  under  this  Guideline  can  and  should \\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \\nfinancial \\nto,  such \\nconsiderations  as  whether  the  foreign  country  is  known  to  target  United \\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \\nrisk of terrorism. \\n\\nincluding,  but  not \\n\\ninterest \\n\\nis \\n\\nlocated, \\n\\nlimited \\n\\n \\n\\nThe  guideline  notes  several  conditions  that could  raise  security  concerns  under \\n\\nAG ¶ 7. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \\n\\n \\n(a)  contact  with  a  foreign  family  member,  business  or  professional \\nassociate,  friend,  or  other  person  who  is  a  citizen  of  or  resident  in  a \\nforeign  country  if  that  contact  creates  a  heightened  risk  of  foreign \\nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \\n \\n(b)  connections  to  a  foreign  person,  group,  government,  or  country  that \\ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual’s obligation to \\nprotect  sensitive  information  or  technology  and  the  individual’s  desire  to \\nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information. \\n \\nApplicant’s  mother  and  five  siblings  are  Vietnamese  citizens  and  reside  in  the \\n  \\nVietnam. Due to his ties to his family, and the threats present in Vietnam as set out in \\nItem  6,  a  heightened  risk  of  foreign  exploitation,  inducement,  manipulation,  pressure, \\nand  coercion  is  present.  The  evidence  is  sufficient  to  raise  the  above  disqualifying \\nconditions. \\n \\n \\nof the mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 8 including: \\n \\n\\nAG ¶ 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \\n\\n(a) the nature of the relationship with foreign persons, the country in which \\nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \\nthat  country  are  such  that  it  is  unlikely  the  individual  will  be  placed  in  a \\nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \\ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.;  \\n \\n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual’s sense of \\nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \\nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n7 \\n\\n\n",
       "and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \\nconflict of interests in favor of the U.S. interests; and \\n \\n(c)  contact  or  communication  with  foreign  citizens  is  so  casual  and \\ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \\ninfluence or exploitation. \\n \\nApplicant  maintains  relationships  with  his  mother  and  siblings,  who  are  citizens \\nand residents of Vietnam. His contact with his mother is the most frequent. The Appeal \\nBoard has held that there is a rebuttable presumption that ties with immediate family are \\nnot  casual.1  The  evidence  shows  that  Applicant  maintains  his  relationship  with  his \\nmother  during  the  year  through  phone  calls  and  her  annual  visits.  He  also  maintains \\nregular contact with his siblings, although that contact is not as frequent as it is with his \\nmother. While none of Applicant’s foreign family members are aware of his request for a \\nsecurity  clearance,  given  these  facts  and  Applicant's  close  ties  to  his  foreign  family \\nmembers, I cannot confidently conclude that Applicant could not be placed in a position \\nof having to choose between the interests of foreign individuals and the interests of the \\nUnited States. AG ¶ 8 (a) and (c) do not apply. \\n\\n \\n Applicant  has  established  deep  and  longstanding  relationships  in  the  United \\nStates. He spent a formative part of his youth in the U.S and attended college here. He \\nchose  to  stay  in  the  United  States  after  finishing  his  education.  He  became  a  U.S. \\ncitizen.  He  is  married  to  an  American  citizen.  His  children  are  U.S.  citizens.  Applicant \\ncan  be expected  to  resolve  any  conflict  of  interest  in favor  of  the  United  States.  AG  ¶ \\n8(b) is mitigating. \\n \\nWhole-Person Concept \\n \\n \\nUnder  the  whole-person  concept,  the  administrative  judge  must  evaluate  an \\napplicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s \\nconduct  and  all  relevant  circumstances.  The  administrative  judge  should  consider  the \\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  \\n \\n\\nthe  nature,  extent,  and  seriousness  of \\nto \\n\\nthe  conduct;  (2) \\nthe \\n(1) \\ncircumstances  surrounding \\ninclude  knowledgeable \\nparticipation;  (3)  the  frequency  and  recency  of  the  conduct;  (4)  the \\nindividual’s  age  and maturity  at  the  time  of the  conduct;  (5)  the  extent to \\nwhich  participation \\nthe  presence  or  absence  of \\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \\nfor  the  conduct;  (8)  the  potential  for  pressure,  coercion,  exploitation,  or \\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \\n\\nthe  conduct, \\n\\nis  voluntary;  (6) \\n\\n \\nUnder AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant  eligibility for a security \\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \\nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \\n\\n                                                           \\n1 ISCR Case No. 00-0484 at 4-5 (App. Bd.

       " \\n\\nI  considered  the  potentially  disqualifying  and  mitigating  conditions  in  light  of  all \\nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \\nGuidelines F and B in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were \\naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. The Foreign \\nInfluence  concerns  related  to  Applicant’s  mother  and  siblings,  who  are  citizens  and \\nresidents  in Vietnam, are mitigated. However,  Applicant has not acted in a trustworthy \\nmanner  when  it  comes  to  addressing  his  financial  delinquencies.  There  is  insufficient \\nevidence  to  demonstrate  that  recurrence  of  financial  irresponsibility  is  unlikely.  The \\npotential for pressure, coercion, or duress remains undiminished. \\n\\n \\nOverall,  the  record  evidence  leaves  me  with  questions  and  doubts  as  to \\nApplicant’s  eligibility  and  suitability  for  a  security  clearance.  For  all  these  reasons,  I \\nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Financial Considerations security concerns. \\n\\n \\n\\nFormal Findings \\n\\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \\n\\n \\n \\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \\n \\n\\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nSubparagraphs 1.a:  \\nSubparagraphs 1.b:  \\nSubparagraphs 1.c:  \\nSubparagraphs 1.d:  \\nSubparagraphs 1.e:  \\nSubparagraphs 1.f:   \\nSubparagraphs 1.g:  \\nSubparagraphs 1.h:  \\n \\n\\nParagraph 2, Guideline B:   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nSubparagraph 2.a:   \\nSubparagraph 2.b:   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\nAGAINST APPLICANT \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\nAgainst Applicant \\nFor Applicant \\nFor Applicant \\nFor Applicant \\nFor Applicant \\nAgainst Applicant \\nAgainst Applicant \\nFor Applicant \\n\\nFOR APPLICANT \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\nFor Applicant \\nFor Applicant \\n\\nConclusion \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it  is not \\nclearly  consistent  with  the  national  interest  to  grant  Applicant  eligibility  for  a  security \\nclearance.

       "The Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On\\nAugust 19, 2015, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\\ndecision–security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of\\nDefense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a decision\\non the written record.  On June 27, 2016, after considering the record, Defense Office of Hearings\\nand Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Martin H. Mogul denied Applicant’s request for a\\nsecurity clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive ¶¶ E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\\n\\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in making findings\\nof fact and whether the Judge’s decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent\\nwith the following, we affirm.\\n\\nThe Judge’s Findings of Fact  \\n\\nApplicant is 46 years old, married, and has four children.  He earned a bachelor’s degree in\\n1994.    Since  2010,  he  has  been  employed  by  a  defense  contractor.    In  his  security  clearance\\napplication, he explained that he encountered difficultly paying bills in 2008 after being laid off\\nfrom a second job due to the company’s bankruptcy.  He gave no explanation for why he did not\\nbegin attempting to resolve the debts until the issuance of the SOR.\\n\\nApplicant admitted each of the five delinquent debts alleged in the SOR.  For the debt in\\nSOR  ¶  1.a  for  about  $500,  Applicant  wrote  in  his  Response  to  Department  Counsel’s  File  of\\nRelevant Material (FORM) that the debt was paid off.  The creditor agreed to accept three monthly\\npayments of about $100 to settle the debt.  A document showed the creditor made arrangements with\\nApplicant to debit electronically about $100 from his account in September 2015 for this debt.  For\\nthe 2009 judgment in SOR ¶ 1.b for about $14,000, Applicant indicated that, at the time he answered\\nthe SOR, he was unable to negotiate a settlement.  In his Response to the FORM, he provided\\ndocuments showing his wages were being garnished biweekly for the next six months for this debt\\nand about $350 was garnished from his pay at the end of November 2015.  No evidence was\\npresented to establish the total amount deducted from his pay or how much is still owed on that debt. \\nFor the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 1.b, and 1.c for about $2,500, $5,600, and $3600, Applicant wrote in\\nhis Response to the FORM that he is currently on a schedule to repay between $150 and $190 a\\nmonth on each debt until it is resolved.  He provided proof of payments toward those debts from\\nSeptember through November 2015.\\n\\nThe Judge’s Analysis\\n\\nThe  Judge  found  Applicant  did  not  act  responsibly  because,  even  though  he  has  been\\nemployed by his current employer since 2010, he only began making payments towards the debts\\nafter the SOR was issued.  The Judge also concluded that, while the mitigation condition concerning\\nthe initiation of a good-faith effort to repay the creditors was applicable, it was not controlling\\nbecause Applicant must establish a consistent history of continuing to resolve his debts. \\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\n2\\n\\n\n",
       "In the appeal brief, Applicant provided character reference letters and documents showing\\npayments  on,  or  settlement  of,  various  debts.    Most  of  those  documents,  however,  were  not\\npreviously submitted to the Judge and constitute new evidence that the Appeal Board is prohibited\\nfrom receiving or considering.  Directive ¶ E3.1.29.  \\n\\nApplicant claims the Judge erred in the findings of fact.  For example, he states that he has\\nsix children (instead of four) and started working for his current employer in 2012 (instead of 2010). \\nIn  his  security  clearance  application,  however,  Applicant  listed  that  he  had  four  children  and\\nindicated he started working for his employer in 2010.  He failed to establish that the Judge erred\\nin the findings of fact.  Our review reveals the Judge’s material findings are based upon substantial\\nevidence or constitute reasonable inferences or conclusions that could be drawn from the record\\nevidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-03420 at 3 (App. Bd. July 25, 2014).  Applicant also argues\\nthat he mitigated the security concerns arising from his debts.  His arguments are not sufficient to\\nshow that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to\\nlaw.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-06634 at 2 (App. Bd. Apr. 28, 2016).   \\n   \\n\\nThe Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the\\ndecision.  The decision is sustainable on this record.  “The general standard is that a clearance may\\nbe granted only when ‘clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.’” Department\\nof the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  See also Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b):  “Any doubt\\nconcerning personnel being considered for access to classified information will be resolved in favor\\nof the national security.”\\n\\nThe Decision is AFFIRMED.  \\n\\nOrder\\n\\nSigned: Michael Ra’anan        \\nMichael Ra’anan\\nAdministrative Judge\\nChairperson, Appeal Board\\n\\nSigned: James E.

(Item\\n1.)  The  action  was  taken  under  Executive  Order  10865,  Safeguarding  Classified\\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\\nDirective  5220.6,  Defense  Industrial  Personnel  Security  Clearance  Review  Program\\n(January  2,  1992),  as  amended  (Directive);  and  the  adjudicative  guidelines  (AG)\\neffective within the Department of Defense after September 1, 2006. \\n\\n \\nOn September 12, 2015, Applicant replied to the SOR (RSOR) in writing, and he\\nrequested that his case be decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. (Item 1.)\\nOn  October  27,  2015,  Department  Counsel  issued  the  Department's  written  case.  A\\ncomplete  copy  of  the  file  of  relevant  material  (FORM)  was  provided  to  Applicant  on\\nNovember  4,  2015.  In  the  FORM,  Department  Counsel  offered  six  documentary\\nexhibits. (Items 1-6.) Applicant was given the opportunity to file objections and submit\\nmaterial in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. A response was due by December 10,\\n2015. Applicant submitted additional evidence, which has been identified and entered\\ninto  evidence  as  Items  A  through  G.  The  case  was  assigned  to  this  Administrative\\n\\n1\\n\\n\n",
       "Judge on January 5, 2016. Based upon a review of the pleadings and exhibits, eligibility\\nfor access to classified information is denied.\\n\\nFindings of Fact\\n\\nAfter  a  complete  and  thorough  review  of  the  evidence  in  the  record,  including\\nApplicant's RSOR and the FORM, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make\\nthe following findings of fact: \\n\\nApplicant  is  46  years  old,  and  he  is  married  and  has  4  children.  He  earned  a\\nBachelor’s  degree  in  1994.  Applicant  has  been  employed  since  2010  as  a  Computer\\nOperator by his current employer,  a defense contractor, and he seeks a DoD security\\nclearance in connection with his employment in the defense sector. (Items 2, F.)\\n\\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\\n\\nThe  SOR  lists  five  allegations  (1.a.  through  1.e.)  regarding  financial  difficulties,\\nspecifically  delinquent  debts,  under  Adjudicative  Guideline  F.  The  allegations  will  be\\ndiscussed below in the same order as they were listed on the SOR:\\n\\n1.a. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR for a collection account in the amount\\nof $518.  In his RSOR, Applicant admitted this SOR allegation. In his Post-FORM letter,\\nApplicant wrote that this debt had been paid off. Applicant also included a letter from the\\ncreditor indicating that they would accept three monthly payments of $104.48 to settle\\nthis debt. (Item A.) Item E shows that the creditor made an arrangement with Applicant\\nto debit electronically $104.48 from Applicant’s account on September 11, 2015, for this\\ndebt.\\n\\n1.b. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR for a judgement filed against Applicant\\nin  April  2009,  in  the  amount  of  $14,892.    In  his  RSOR,  Applicant  admitted  this  SOR\\nallegation,  and  he  wrote  that  he  was  unable  to  negotiate  at  this  time.  (Item  1.)  In  his\\nPost-FORM letter, Applicant wrote that this judgment debt had been placed with a law\\nfirm that informed Applicant a portion of his wages would be garnished bi-weekly for the\\nnext  six  months.  (Item  A.)  Items  F  and  G  show  that  $357.73  was  deducted  from  the\\npaycheck of Applicant on November 29, 2015.  No evidence was introduced to establish\\nthe total amount that has been deducted from Applicant’s pay or how much is still owing\\non this debt. \\n\\n1.c. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR for a collection account in the amount\\nof $2,506. In his RSOR, Applicant admitted this SOR allegation. (Item 1.) In his Post-\\nFORM letter, Applicant wrote that he is currently on a payment schedule for this debt to\\npay $156.25 a month until this debt is resolved. (Item A.) Item E shows that Applicant\\nhas  made  one  payment  of  $163.75  on  September  14,  2015,  and  two  payments  of\\n$156.25 on October 14, 2015, and November 17, 2015, toward this debt.\\n\\n1.d. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR for a collection account in the amount\\nof $5,649. In his RSOR, Applicant admitted this SOR allegation. (Item 1.) In his Post-\\n\\n2\\n\\n\n",
       "FORM letter, Applicant wrote that he is currently on a payment schedule for this debt to\\npay $187.90 a month until this debt is resolved. (Item A.) Item D shows that Applicant\\nhas made three payments of $187.90 on September 28, 2015; October 26, 2015; and\\nNovember 23, 2015; and three additional payments of $104.48.\\n\\n1.e. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR for a collection account in the amount\\nof $3,677.  In his RSOR, Applicant admitted this SOR allegation. (Item 1.) In his Post-\\nFORM letter, Applicant wrote that he is currently on a payment schedule for this debt to\\npay $155 a month until this debt is resolved. (Item A.) Item C shows that Applicant has\\nmade two payments of $155 on October 26, 2015, and November 23, 2015, toward this\\ndebt.\\n\\nApplicant  completed  an  Electronic  Questionnaires  for  Investigations  Processing\\n(e-QIP) on July 26, 2011, and he explained each of his delinquent debts, writing, “In Year\\n2008, had difficulty paying bills due to being laid off at 2  job due to company file [sic]\\nbankruptcy.”  (Item  2.)  As  reviewed  above,  Applicant  began  working  at  his present\\nemployment in 2010, but he gave no explanation for why he did not begin attempting to\\nresolve his debts until  2015, after the SOR was issued. \\n\\nnd\\n\\nPolicies\\n\\nWhen  evaluating  an  applicant’s  suitability \\n\\nthe\\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\\nto  brief  introductory  explanations  for  each  guideline,  the  adjudicative  guidelines  list\\npotentially  disqualifying  conditions  and  mitigating  conditions,  which  are  useful  in\\nevaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information.\\n\\nfor  a  security  clearance, \\n\\nThese  guidelines  are  not  inflexible  rules  of  law.  Instead,  recognizing  the\\ncomplexities  of  human  behavior,  these  guidelines  are  applied  in  conjunction  with  the\\nfactors  listed  in  the  adjudicative  process.  The  administrative  judge’s  over-arching\\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 2(c),\\nthe  entire  process  is  a  conscientious  scrutiny  of  a  number  of  variables  known  as  the\\n“whole-person  concept.”  The  administrative  judge  must  consider  all  available,  reliable\\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\\ndecision.\\n\\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b)\\nrequires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\\ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this decision, I have\\ndrawn  only  those  conclusions  that  are  reasonable,  logical  and  based  on  the  evidence\\ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere\\nspeculation or conjecture.\\n\\nUnder  Directive  ¶  E3.1.14,  the  Government  must  present  evidence  to  establish\\ncontroverted  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  Under  Directive  ¶  E3.1.15,  the  Applicant  is\\nresponsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\\nmitigate  facts  admitted  by  applicant  or  proven  by  Department  Counsel.  .  .  .”  The\\n\\n3\\n\\n\n",
       "Applicant  has  the  ultimate  burden  of  persuasion  as  to  obtaining  a  favorable  security\\ndecision. \\n\\nA  person  who  seeks  access  to  classified  information  enters  into  a  fiduciary\\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government\\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\\nthe  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  protect  or  safeguard  classified\\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as\\nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\\n\\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of\\nthe  national  interest and  shall in no  sense be  a determination  as  to the  loyalty  of  the\\napplicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \\n\\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\\n\\nAnalysis\\n\\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\\n\\nout in AG ¶ 18:  \\n\\n      Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet\\nfinancial  obligations  may  indicate  poor  self-control,  lack  of  judgment,  or\\nunwillingness  to  abide  by  rules  and  regulations,  all  of  which  can  raise\\nquestions  about  an  individual’s  reliability,  trustworthiness  and  ability  to\\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \\n\\nThe  guideline  notes  several  conditions  that  could  raise  security  concerns  and\\ncould potentially apply in this case.  Under AG ¶ 19(a), “an inability or unwillingness to\\nsatisfy  debts,”  is  potentially  disqualifying.  Similarly  under  AG  ¶  19(c),  “a  history  of  not\\nmeeting  financial  obligations,”  may  raise  security  concerns.  I  find  that  both  of  these\\ndisqualifying  conditions  apply  to  Applicant  in  this  case.  The  evidence  has  established\\nthat Applicant accumulated significant delinquent debt several years ago.  \\n\\nAG ¶ 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns from financial\\ndifficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(b), it may be mitigating where, “the conditions that resulted in\\nthe financial problem were largely beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment,\\na  business  downturn,  unexpected  medical  emergency,  or  a  death,  divorce  or\\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.” As reviewed\\nabove,  some  of  Applicant’s  financial  difficulties  occurred  as  a  result  of  his  periods  of\\nunemployment. However, since Applicant has been employed by his current employer\\nsince 2010, and only began making payments toward the SOR debts after the SOR was\\n\\n4\\n\\n\n",
       "issued in 2015, I find that Applicant has not acted responsibly. Accordingly, I find that this\\nmitigating condition is not applicable in this case. \\n\\n¶  20(d)  is  now  applicable  but  not  controlling,  since  Applicant  has  begun  taking\\naction to “initiate a good-faith effort to repay his overdue creditors or otherwise resolve\\ndebts,”  because  even  though  he  has  been  working  at  his  present  employment  since\\n2010,  he  did  not  begin  this  process  until  after  the  SOR  was  issued  in  2015.  To  be\\napplicable and controlling in the future, Applicant must establish a consistent history of\\ncontinuing  to  resolve  these  delinquent  past  debts  and  not  become  past  due  on  his\\npresent debts. At this time, I find Guideline F against Applicant.\\n\\nWhole-Person Concept\\n\\nUnder  the  whole-person  concept,  the  administrative  judge  must  evaluate  an\\napplicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s\\nconduct  and  all  the  circumstances.  The  administrative  judge  should  consider  the  nine\\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a): \\n\\nthe  conduct, \\n\\nto \\n\\n(1)  the  nature,  extent,  and  seriousness  of  the  conduct;  (2)  the\\ncircumstances  surrounding \\ninclude  knowledgeable\\nparticipation;  (3)  the  frequency  and  recency  of  the  conduct;  (4)  the\\nindividual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\\nwhich  participation \\nthe  presence  or  absence  of\\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\\nfor  the  conduct;  (8)  the  potential  for  pressure,  coercion,  exploitation,  or\\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\\n\\nis  voluntary;  (6) \\n\\nUnder AG ¶ 2 (c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\\nsecurity  clearance  must  be  an  overall  commonsense  judgment  based  upon  careful\\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.      \\n\\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the\\nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. Based on all of the reasons cited above\\nas to why the mitigating conditions are not applicable at this time, I find that the record\\nevidence leaves me with significant questions and doubts as to Applicant’s eligibility and\\nsuitability  for  a  security  clearance  under  the  whole-person  concept.  For  all  these\\nreasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns under the whole-\\nperson concept. \\n\\nFormal Findings\\n\\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\\n\\nrequired by ¶ E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\\n\\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\\n\\nAGAINST APPLICANT\\n\\nSubparagraphs 1.a. - 1.e.:\\n\\nAgainst  Applicant\\n\\n5\\n\\n\n",

The facts administratively noticed are \\nsummarized in the Findings of Fact, below. \\n \\n\\nFindings of Fact \\n\\n \\n\\nApplicant  admitted  all  of  the  SOR  allegations.  He  is  a  39-year-old  analyst \\nemployed  by  a  defense  contractor  since  March  2015.  He  worked  for  a  prior  defense \\ncontractor,  at  a  U.S.  Embassy  overseas,  from  January  2008  to  February  2009.  He \\nworked for another defense contractor from August 2010 to November 2012. He was \\ngranted eligibility for a public trust position by another federal agency in 2008. He was \\ngranted a DOD security clearance in 2014.1  \\n\\n \\nApplicant  is  a  native-born  U.S. citizen  and  resident. He  obtained  a  high-school \\ndiploma in the United States in 1996 and a bachelor’s degree from a U.S. university in \\n2001. He was previously married from September 2009 to November 2010. As of the \\nhearing, he was engaged to a native-born U.S. citizen. He does not have any children.2 \\n\\n \\nApplicant enlisted and served as an active duty infantryman in the Israeli military \\nfrom November 2004 to February 2006. Upon completion of his service, he declined an \\noffer to serve in the Israeli military reserves and was honorably discharged. His primary \\nmotivation for serving in the Israeli military was to develop the skills and experience that \\nwould assist him in furthering a career in security in support of the U.S. Government. He \\ninitially desired to serve in the U.S. military, but learned when he spoke to recruiters that \\nhe  was  ineligible  due  to  a  longstanding  medical  condition.  He  explored  alternative \\noptions  to  serve  the  U.S.  Government  through  security  positions  with  defense \\ncontractors  and  in  the  private  sector,  but  discovered  that  all  such  positions  required \\nprior military experience. He did not inquire whether his medical condition would have \\ndisqualified him from holding these positions since he did not meet the requisite criteria \\nof  prior  military  service.  He  did  not  explore  options  that  did  not  require  prior  military \\n\\n                                                           \\n1 Applicant’s response to the SOR; Tr. at 24-25, 70-77; GEs 1-3; AE B.  \\n \\n2 Tr. at 55-125; GE 1. \\n \\n\\n \\n2 \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "experience because such positions would not have provided him with the opportunity to \\ndevelop skills in his desired field.3   \\n\\n \\nApplicant discovered through internet research a program designed for overseas \\nJewish volunteers who had an interest in serving in the Israeli military, so long as one \\nprovided evidence of Jewish heritage. He decided then, at the age of 23, that it was a \\nreasonable option for him to serve in the Israeli military given that the United States and \\nIsrael  were  allies  with  mutual  adversaries.  He  made  this  decision  on  his  own.  He \\ndiscussed  his  decision  with  his  parents,  and  their  conversations  revolved  primarily \\naround their concern for Applicant’s safety.4 \\n\\n \\nIn  2004,  Applicant  traveled  to  Israel  to  join  the  Israeli  military.  Acting  on  the \\nrecommendation  that  he  have  a  basic  proficiency  of  Hebrew  prior  to  enlistment, \\nApplicant  first  engaged  in  a  five-month  language  instruction  program.  The  language \\nprogram  was  not  affiliated  with  the  Israeli  military.  He  subsequently  enlisted  and  the \\nIsraeli military sent him to additional language training.5  \\n\\n \\nDuring the enlistment process, Applicant lied and told the Israeli military that he \\ndid  not  have  the  medical  condition  that  rendered  him  ineligible  to  serve  in  the  U.S. \\nmilitary. He did so because he was told, at an initial enlistment meeting when he arrived \\nin Israel, that his longstanding medical condition, combined with another of his medical \\nconditions, would have lowered his physical profile to such a degree that would have \\ndisqualified  him  from  serving  as  an  infantryman.  He  was  previously  unaware  of  this \\ninformation. He understood from his internet research prior to traveling to Israel that he \\nwould  be  permitted  to  serve  in  some  capacity  despite  his  medical  condition.  He  also \\nunderstood that his medical condition was not necessarily a disqualifier for joining the \\ninfantry.6  \\n\\n \\nApplicant  determined  that  while  he  was  unwilling  to  lie  to  the  U.S.  military  and \\ngovernment about this particular medical condition, it was acceptable for him to lie to \\nthe  Israeli  military  and  government  since  he  did  not  have  any  allegiance  to  them.  He \\nwas not concerned his medical condition would be discovered because he managed it \\nand  was  able  to  maintain  a  high  level  of  fitness.

       " \\nApplicant’s  ex-girlfriend  resides  in  Israel.  He  met  her  on  an  online  dating  site \\nwhen he attended the five-month language instruction program in Israel. He lived with \\nher while he was serving in the Israeli military. He last communicated with her in 2007. \\nWhen  Applicant  moved  back  to  the  United  States  from  Israel  in  2007,  he  had  social \\nmedia contact with her. He also had social media contact with her one sister who also \\nresides  in  Israel,  and  several  individuals  in  Israel  with  whom  Applicant  served  in  the \\nIsraeli  military,  to  include  his  unit  supervisor.  After  he  received  the  SOR,  Applicant \\ndeleted all of his foreign contacts on social media. He had not previously deleted them \\nbecause  he  consulted  and  was  advised  by  a  former  colleague  that  doing  so  at  once \\nmight trigger to any one of his foreign contacts who might be working in the intelligence \\nfield that he was pursuing a sensitive position. He ultimately decided that since he was \\nnot  in  communication  with  any  of  his  foreign  contacts,  he  did  not  need  to  maintain  a \\nsocial  media  connection  with  them.  Since  he  deleted  his  foreign  contacts  on  social \\nmedia, some have tried to reconnect with him but Applicant has not responded and has \\nno intentions of doing so.8 \\n  \\n \\nApplicant maintains contact with one individual, a U.S. citizen and resident, with \\nwhom Applicant served in the Israeli military. This individual is the founder and CEO of \\na civilian national service organization that has no connections to the Israeli government \\nor military. As an American Jew, this individual chose to serve in the Israeli military and \\ndid  so  for  two  years  in  the  same  unit  as  Applicant.  He  attested  that  both  he  and \\nApplicant  were  low-level  infantrymen.  Since  their  discharge  from  the  Israeli  military, \\nApplicant  and \\nindividual  see  each  other  once  yearly  and  communicate \\napproximately twice yearly.9 \\n \\nAfter  graduating  from  college  and  before  he  served  in  the  Israeli  military, \\n \\nApplicant took a trip to Israel in August 2002 through a birthright program. The program \\nhelped teach him about his Jewish culture. Subsequent to his Israeli military service and \\nduring a period of unemployment, he traveled to Israel in June 2010 through the same \\nbirthright  program.  On  this  occasion,  he  served  as  a  volunteer  male  counselor  to  the \\nprogram.  He  did  not  see  any  of  his  former  Israeli  military  contacts  or  his  ex-girlfriend \\nduring this trip. Both trips were comprised of U.S. citizens, all Jewish Americans, who \\nwanted  to  travel  to  Israel  to  learn  more  about  their  Jewish  culture.  He  has  not  since \\ntraveled  to  Israel.  Should  he  travel  to  Israel  or  any  foreign  country  in  the  future,  he \\nunderstands  as  a  security  clearance  holder  the  requirement  to  report  such  foreign \\ntravel.10 \\n \\n \\nApplicant did not have an Israeli security clearance when he served in the Israeli \\nmilitary. He has never been an Israeli citizen, as he was not required to become one in \\norder to serve in the Israeli military, and as such he has never held an Israeli passport. \\nHe chose not to become an Israeli citizen or obtain an Israeli passport because he did \\n\\nthis \\n\\n                                                           \\n8 Tr. at 55-125; GEs 1-3. \\n \\n9 Tr. at 55-125; GEs 1-3; AE F. \\n \\n10 Tr. at 55-125; GEs 1-3. \\n \\n\\n \\n4 \\n \\n\\n\n",

However, U.S. aid \\nto  Israel  is  not  unlimited.

       "Assistance Agreement between the United  States and Israel. AECA enumerates the \\npurposes  for  which  foreign  governments  can  use  U.S.  military  articles  and  limits  the \\nability of foreign governments to transfer U.S. military products to third party countries \\nwithout the prior consent of the President of the United States. The 1952 agreement \\nstates  that  the  government  of  Israel  assures  the  United  States  government  that \\nequipment, materials, or services acquired from the United States are required for and \\nwill  be  used  solely  to  maintain  Israel’s  internal  security  and  Israel’s  legitimate  self-\\ndefense.  \\n \\n \\nAlthough the United States has provided regular military support to Israel, there \\nis a significant documented history of classified information and controlled technologies \\nbeing illegally imported to Israel. These include parts used in fighter jets, spy software, \\ncomponents  for  certain  missiles  and  fighter  jet  aircraft,  digital  oscilloscopes  that  are \\ncapable of being utilized in the development of weapons of mass destruction and  in \\nmissile  delivery  fields,  a  product  containing  a  certain  chemical  precursor  that  is \\ncontrolled  for  chemical,  biological,  antiterrorism,  and  chemical  reasons,  pressure \\ntransducers  that  are  controlled  for  nuclear  non-proliferation  reasons,  encryption \\nsoftware  that  is  controlled  for  national  security  reasons,  and  classified  documents. \\nIllegal  technology  transfers,  even  to  private  Israeli  entities,  are  a  significant  concern \\nbecause  foreign  government  entities  have  learned  to  capitalize  on  private-sector \\ntechnology acquisitions.  \\n \\n \\nIn the past 30 years, there have been at least three cases in which employees \\nof the U.S. Government were convicted of disclosing classified information to Israel or \\nof  conspiracy  to  act  as  an  Israeli  agent.  Reports  indicate  that  concerns  regarding \\npossible Israeli espionage persist among U.S. officials. The most prominent espionage \\ncase is that of Jonathan Pollard. He pled guilty in 1986, with his then wife, to selling \\nclassified documents to Israel. Israel granted Pollard, who is serving a life sentence in \\na U.S. federal prison, citizenship in 1996 and, in 1998, acknowledged that Pollard had \\nbeen its agent. \\n \\n \\nA  travel  warning  issued  by  the  U.S.  Department  of  State  for  Israel,  the  West \\nBank, and Gaza remains in effect, as the security environment remains complex due to \\nheightened  tensions  and  security  risks.  U.S.  citizens  are  advised  that  all  persons \\nentering or departing Israel, the West Bank, or Gaza are subject to security screening, \\nand may be denied entry or exit. Israeli security officials have on occasion requested \\naccess  to  travelers’  personal  email  accounts  or  other  social  media  accounts  as  a \\ncondition  of  entry.  In  such  circumstances,  travelers  should  have  no  expectation  of \\nprivacy for any data stored on such devices or in their accounts. \\n  \\n\\n \\n\\nWhen  evaluating  an  applicant’s  suitability \\n\\n \\nthe \\nadministrative  judge  must  consider  the  adjudicative  guidelines.  In  addition  to  brief \\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \\ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \\napplicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. \\n\\nfor  a  security  clearance, \\n\\nPolicies \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n6 \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "These  guidelines  are  not  inflexible  rules  of  law.  Instead,  recognizing  the \\ncomplexities  of  human  behavior,  administrative  judges  apply  the  guidelines  in \\nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s \\noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \\nto  AG  ¶  2(a),  the  entire  process  is  a  conscientious  scrutiny  of  a  number  of  variables \\nknown  as  the  “whole-person  concept.”  The  administrative  judge  must  consider  all \\navailable,  reliable  information  about  the  person,  past  and  present,  favorable  and \\nunfavorable, in making a decision. \\n\\n \\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) \\nrequires  that  “[a]ny  doubt  concerning  personnel  being  considered  for  access  to \\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.”  \\n\\n \\nUnder Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \\ncontroverted  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  Under  Directive  ¶  E3.1.15,  the  applicant  is \\nresponsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \\nor  mitigate  facts  admitted  by  the  applicant  or  proven  by  Department  Counsel.”  The \\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \\n\\nthe  Government  predicated  upon \\n\\n \\nA  person  who  seeks  access  to  classified  information  enters  into  a  fiduciary \\n \\nrelationship  with \\ntrust  and  confidence.  This \\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \\nGovernment  reposes  a  high  degree  of  trust  and  confidence  in  individuals  to  whom  it \\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \\nthe  possible  risk  the  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  safeguard \\nclassified  information.  Such  decisions  entail  a  certain  degree  of  legally  permissible \\nextrapolation  of  potential,  rather  than  actual,  risk  of  compromise  of  classified \\ninformation. \\n \\n\\nSection 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be “in terms \\nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \\napplicant  concerned.”  See  also  Exec.  Or.  12968,  Section  3.1(b)  (listing  multiple \\nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \\n\\nAnalysis \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \\n \\n\\nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG ¶ 6:       \\n\\nForeign  contacts  and  interests,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  business, \\nfinancial,  and  property  interests,  are  a  national  security  concern  if  they \\nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \\nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \\nway  inconsistent  with  U.S.  interests  or  otherwise  made  vulnerable  to \\npressure  or  coercion  by  any  foreign  interest.  Assessment  of  foreign \\n\\n \\n7 \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "contacts  and  interests  should  consider  the  country  in  which  the  foreign \\ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \\nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \\nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \\n \\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \\n\\nAG ¶ 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \\n\\ninformation  or \\n\\n \\n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \\nor  professional  associate,  friend,  or  other  person  who  is  a  citizen  of  or \\nresident  in  a  foreign  country  if  that  contact  creates  a  heightened  risk  of \\nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \\n \\n(b)  connections  to  a  foreign  person,  group,  government,  or  country  that \\ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \\nprotect  classified  or  sensitive \\nthe \\nindividual’s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \\nthat information or technology. \\n \\nThe  nature  of  a  nation’s  government,  its  relationship  with  the  United  States, \\nand its human  rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant’s \\nfamily  members  are  vulnerable  to  government  coercion.  The  risk  of  coercion, \\npersuasion,  or  duress  is  significantly  greater \\nforeign  country  has  an \\nauthoritarian  government,  a  family member is associated with or dependent upon the \\ngovernment,  or  the  country  is  known  to  conduct  intelligence  operations  against  the \\nUnited  States.  In  considering  the  nature  of  the  government,  an  administrative  judge \\nmust  also  consider  any  terrorist  activity  in  the  country  at  issue.  See  generally  ISCR \\nCase  No.  02-26130  at  3  (App.  Bd.  Dec.  7,  2006)  (reversing  decision  to  grant \\nclearance  where  administrative  judge  did  not  consider  terrorist  activity  in  area  where \\nfamily members resided). \\n \\n\\ntechnology  and \\n\\nif \\n\\nthe \\n\\nAG  ¶  7(a)  requires  substantial  evidence  of  a  “heightened  risk.”  The \\n“heightened  risk” required to raise one of these disqualifying conditions is a relatively \\nlow standard.  “Heightened risk” denotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in \\nhaving a family member living under a foreign government. \\n\\n \\nApplicant has not communicated with his ex-girlfriend in Israel since 2007. When \\nApplicant moved back to the United States from Israel in 2007, he had limited social \\nmedia contact with her, her one sister, and several other individuals in Israel with whom \\nhe served in the Israeli military. He deleted all of his social media foreign contacts after \\nhe received the SOR. He has not responded and has no intentions of responding to any \\nattempts  by  these  foreign  contacts  to  reconnect  on  social  media.  While  Applicant \\nmaintains  contact with one individual  with  whom he served in the Israeli military, this \\nindividual is a U.S. citizen and resident with no ties to the Israeli government or military.       \\nAG ¶¶ 7(a) and 7(b) are not established. \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n8 \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "Guideline C, Foreign Preference \\n \\n\\nThe security concern for foreign preference is set out in AG ¶ 9:     \\n \\nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign \\ncountry over the United States, then he or she may provide information or make \\ndecisions  that  are  harmful  to  the  interests  of  the  United  States.  Foreign \\ninvolvement  raises  concerns  about  an  individual's  judgment,  reliability,  and \\ntrustworthiness  when  it  is  in  conflict  with  U.S.  national  interests  or  when  the \\nindividual acts to conceal it. By itself; the fact that a U.S. citizen is also a citizen \\nof  another  country  is  not  disqualifying  without  an  objective  showing  of  such \\nconflict or attempt at concealment. The same is true for a U.S. citizen's exercise \\nof any right or privilege of foreign citizenship and any action to acquire or obtain \\nrecognition of a foreign citizenship. \\n \\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \\n\\nAG ¶ 10. The following is potentially applicable in this case:   \\n\\n \\n(d) participation in foreign activities, including but not limited to: \\n\\n(1) assuming or attempting to assume any type of employment, position, or  \\npolitical office in a foreign government or military organization. \\n\\nApplicant’s service in the Israeli military from November 2004 to February 2006 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nraises AG ¶ 10(d).   \\n \\n\\nConditions that could mitigate foreign preference security concerns are provided  \\n\\nunder AG ¶ 11. The following are potentially applicable: \\n \\n\\n(f)  the  foreign  preference,  if  detected,  involves  a  foreign  country,  entity,  or \\nassociation that poses a low national security risk; and \\n \\n(g) civil employment or military service was authorized under U.S. law, or  \\nthe employment or service was otherwise consented to as required by U.S. law. \\n \\n \\nAs  a  23  year  old,  Applicant  decided  that  serving  in  the  Israeli  military  would \\nenable him to further his desired career in security in support of the U.S. Government. \\nSince  his  longstanding  medical  condition,  which  he  determined  he  did  not  have  to \\ndisclose to the Israeli military, rendered him ineligible to serve in the U.S. military, he \\nviewed  his  decision  as  a  reasonable  option.  That  the  United  States  and  Israel  were \\nallies  with  mutual  adversaries  also  factored  into  his  decision.  He  has  matured  since \\nthen.  He  acknowledged  he  should  have  disclosed  his  medical  condition  to  the  Israeli \\nmilitary. His Israeli military service occurred between 11 and 13 years ago. He no longer \\nhas any ties to the Israeli government or military. He has never been an Israeli citizen, \\nhe  has  never  held  an  Israeli  passport,  and  he  has  never  held  an  Israeli  security \\nclearance. AG ¶¶ 11(f) and 11(g) are applicable. \\n  \\n\\n \\n9 \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "Whole-Person Concept \\n \\nUnder  the  whole-person  concept,  the  administrative  judge  must  evaluate  an \\n \\napplicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s \\nconduct  and  all  relevant  circumstances.  The  administrative  judge  should  consider  the \\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d):  \\n \\n\\nthe  conduct, \\n\\nis  voluntary;  (6) \\n\\nthe  nature,  extent,  and  seriousness  of \\nto \\n\\nthe \\nthe  conduct;  (2) \\n(1) \\ncircumstances  surrounding \\ninclude  knowledgeable \\nparticipation;  (3)  the  frequency  and  recency  of  the  conduct;  (4)  the \\nindividual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \\nwhich  participation \\nthe  presence  or  absence  of \\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \\nfor  the  conduct;  (8)  the  potential  for  pressure,  coercion,  exploitation,  or \\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \\n \\n \\nUnder  AG ¶  2(c), the  ultimate  determination  of  whether to  grant  eligibility  for a \\nsecurity  clearance  must  be  an  overall  commonsense  judgment  based  upon  careful \\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \\n \\n\\nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines B and C in my whole-person \\nanalysis.  After  weighing  the  disqualifying  and  mitigating  conditions  under  both \\nguidelines,  and  evaluating  all  the  evidence  in  the  context  of  the  whole  person,  I \\nconclude  Applicant  has  mitigated  the  foreign  influence  and  foreign  preference \\nsecurity  concerns.  Accordingly,  I  conclude  he  has  carried  his  burden  of  showing \\nthat  it  is  clearly  consistent  with  the  national  interest  to  continue  his  eligibility  for \\naccess to classified information. \\n\\n \\n\\nFormal Findings \\n\\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \\n\\n \\n \\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\nParagraph 1, Guideline C:   \\nSubparagraph 1.a:   \\n \\nParagraph 2, Guideline B:   \\nSubparagraphs 2.a - 2.b: \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\nFor Applicant \\nFor Applicant \\nFor Applicant \\nFor Applicant \\n\\nConclusion \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nIn  light  of  all  of  the  circumstances  presented  by  the  record  in  this  case,  it  is \\nclearly  consistent  with  the  national  interest  to  continue  Applicant’s  eligibility  for  a \\nsecurity clearance.

On  November  3,  2014,  the  Department  of  Defense \\nConsolidated  Adjudications  Facility  (DODCAF)  issued  Applicant  a  Statement  of \\nReasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guidelines F and E. The  action was \\ntaken  under  Executive  Order  10865,  Safeguarding  Classified  Information  Within \\nIndustry  (February  20,  1960),  as  amended;  Department  of  Defense  Directive  5220.6, \\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \\namended  (Directive);  and  the  adjudicative  guidelines  (AG)  effective  within  the \\nDepartment of Defense on September 1, 2006.  \\n\\n \\nApplicant  answered  the  SOR  in  writing  on  December  8,  2014.  Applicant \\n\\nrequested his case be decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.  \\n\\n \\nOn April 17, 2015, Department Counsel submitted the Department=s written case. \\nA complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM), consisting of Items 1 to 7, was \\n\\n \\n1 \\n \\n \\n\\n\n",

Applicant \\nreceived the FORM on September 14, 2015.  \\n\\n \\nApplicant  did  not  file  a  Response  to  the  FORM  within  the  30  day  time  allowed \\n\\nthat would have expired on October 14, 2015.  \\n\\n \\nI  received  the  case assignment on  November  5,  2015. Based  upon  a  review  of \\n\\nthe pleadings and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \\n\\n \\n\\nFindings of Fact \\n\\n \\n\\nApplicant admitted   allegations in Subparagraphs 1.a to 1.g , then fails to admit \\nor deny 1.h, and 1i., then admits and disputes 1.j to 1.m, and fails to admit or deny 1.n \\nto 1.q. in Paragraph 1 concerning financial debts. He admitted the 10 allegations under \\nParagraph  2  alleging  20  personal  conduct  security  violations.  He  further  stated  in  his \\nAnswer  that  Subparagraphs  1.d  to  1.h  were  ”investigated  by  management”  without \\ndisclosing the results of those investigations. (Items 1-7)  \\n\\n \\nApplicant  is  35  years  old,  married  having  been  previously  divorced,  and  has \\nthree children and one stepchild. He works as a security guard for a defense contractor. \\nApplicant served in the U.S. Marines from 1998 to 2002. (Items 2-4) \\n \\n \\nApplicant  owes  $129,524  for  these  17  delinquent  debts.  His  Answer  states  he \\npaid  five  debts  (Subparagraphs  1.c,  1.e,  1.h,  1.i,  1.o),  has  installment  agreements  for \\nsix other debts (Subparagraphs 1.a, 1b, 1.d, 1.g, 1.n, 1.p, and 1.q), and is disputing four \\nother  debts  (Subparagraphs  1.j  to  1.m).  The  debt  to  an  insurance  company  in \\nSubparagraph 1.f he simply admits with no other explanation. The earliest debt is dated \\nin 2004.  (Items 1-7) \\n \\n \\nApplicant’s  Personal  Financial  Statement  submitted  with  his  interrogatory \\nanswers  states  his  2004  divorce  and  physical  injury  in  2010  caused  his  financial \\ndifficulties, but they are  “turning around” now. Applicant did not submit any documents \\nto support his SOR answers that debts are paid or being paid on the installment basis. \\nHe did not submit any dispute letters on other debts. He did not respond to the FORM. \\n(Items 1-7) \\n \\n \\nApplicant has numerous violations on his work record for his employer, for whom \\nhe has worked since 2004. Applicant had non-medical call-offs between 2004 and 2013, \\ntardiness in the same time, and several counseling sessions. The counseling pertained \\nto  his  possession  of  a  personal  cell  phone  at  the  work  site,  conducting  personal \\nbusiness on a government telephone, having a beverage at the work site, failing to sign \\nin after a meal break, failure to maintain his uniform, failure to execute his duties when \\nhe did not take a key inventory, failure to sign a schedule receipt for four hours of hold \\nover work he performed, failure to park a work vehicle in the correct location for which a \\n\\n \\n\\n2 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "parking ticket was issued to his employer, failure to sign into work, failure to hand carry \\na  package  to  the  addressee  that  resulted  in  a  processing  delay,  and  allowing  an \\nunauthorized  vehicle  to  gain  access  to  a  facility  without  properly  obtaining  valid \\nidentification  from  the  driver  and  vehicle  inspection  in  December  2006.  Applicant \\nreceived  a  letter  of  suspension  in  May  2006.  In  October  2006  he  received  a  two  day \\nsuspension.  In  December  2006  termination  was  started,  in  September  2011  Applicant \\nwas suspended for two days after having a cell phone at the work site, and in February \\n2012  he  received  a  one  day  suspension for  being  tardy  for  work  four  times.  Applicant \\nadmitted  all  these  violations  with  the  notation  on  the  disciplinary  accusations  that \\n“management investigated” them. (Items 1-7) \\n \\n \\nApplicant’s file contains several hundred pages of documents listing his violations \\nas  alleged  in  the  SOR  and  the  disciplinary  action  taken  by  his  employer.  These \\ndocuments support each SOR allegation. (Item 4) \\n  \\n\\n     Applicant  did  not  submit  any  documentation  that  he  has  participated  in  credit \\ncounseling or budget education. He provided no evidence concerning the quality of his \\njob  performance.  He  submitted  no  character  references  or  other  evidence  tending  to \\nestablish  good  judgment,  trustworthiness,  or  reliability.  I  was  unable  to  evaluate  his \\ncredibility, demeanor, or character in person since he elected to have his case decided \\nwithout a hearing. \\n \\n\\nPolicies \\n\\n \\n\\nWhen  evaluating  an  applicant=s  suitability \\n\\nthe \\nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \\nintroductory  explanations  for  each  guideline,  the  adjudicative  guidelines  list  potentially \\ndisqualifying  conditions  and  mitigating  conditions,  which  are  useful  in  evaluating  an \\napplicant=s eligibility for access to classified information. \\n\\nfor  a  security  clearance, \\n\\n \\nThese  guidelines  are  not  inflexible  rules  of  law.  Instead,  recognizing  the \\ncomplexities  of  human  behavior,  the  administrative  judge  applies  the  guidelines  in \\nconjunction  with  the  factors  listed  in  AG  ¶  2  describing  the  adjudicative  process.  The \\nadministrative \\nimpartial,  and \\ncommonsense decision. According to AG  & 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious \\nscrutiny  of  a  number  of  variables  known  as  the  Awhole-person  concept.@  The \\nadministrative  judge  must  consider  all  available,  reliable  information  about  the  person, \\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \\n\\njudge=s  overarching  adjudicative  goal \\n\\nis  a \\n\\nfair, \\n\\n \\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG & 2(b) \\nrequires  that  A[a]ny  doubt  concerning  personnel  being  considered  for  access  to \\nclassified  information  will  be  resolved  in  favor  of  national  security.@  In  reaching  this \\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \\nthe evidence contained in the record.  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n3 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "According  to  Directive  &  E3.1.14,  the  Government  must  present  evidence  to \\nestablish  controverted  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  Under  Directive  &  E3.1.15,  an \\n“applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \\nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \\nand  has  the  ultimate  burden  of  persuasion  as  to  obtaining  a  favorable  clearance \\ndecision.”  \\n\\nthe  Government  predicated  upon \\n\\n \\nA  person  who  seeks  access  to  classified  information  enters  into  a  fiduciary \\nrelationship  with \\ntrust  and  confidence.  This \\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \\nGovernment  reposes  a  high  degree  of  trust  and  confidence  in  individuals  to  whom  it \\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \\nthe  possible  risk  the  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  protect  or \\nsafeguard  classified  information.  Such  decisions  entail  a  certain  degree  of  legally \\npermissible  extrapolation  as  to  potential,  rather  than  actual,  risk  of  compromise  of \\nclassified information. See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \\n \\n\\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \\n \\n\\nAnalysis \\n\\n \\n\\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \\n\\nout in AG & 18:       \\n \\n\\nFailure  or  inability  to  live  within  one=s  means,  satisfy  debts,  and  meet \\nfinancial  obligations  may  indicate  poor  self-control,  lack  of  judgment,  or \\nunwillingness  to  abide  by  rules  and  regulations,  all  of  which  can  raise \\nquestions  about  an  individual=s  reliability,  trustworthiness  and  ability  to \\nprotect  classified \\nfinancially \\noverextended  is  at  risk  of  having  to  engage  in  illegal  acts  to  generate \\nfunds.  \\n\\ninformation.  An \\n\\nindividual  who \\n\\nis \\n\\n \\n\\nThe guideline at AG & 19 contains nine disqualifying conditions that could raise \\nsecurity concerns. From these nine conditions, two conditions are applicable to the facts \\nfound in this case: \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and   \\n \\n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \\n \\n \\nFrom  2004  to  the  present,  Applicant  accumulated  17  delinquent  debts,  totaling \\n$129,524 that remain unpaid or unresolved. Applicant has not shown clearly what debts \\nhe paid or is paying beyond his mere statements in his Answer.

       " \\nstatus of his debts cannot be known. An in-depth review of the Items in the file shows \\nno support for his alleged payments.  \\n \\n\\nThe  guideline  in  AG  ¶  20  contains  six  conditions  that  could  mitigate  security \\nconcerns  arising  from  financial  difficulties.  Only  one  mitigating  condition  might  have \\npartial applicability. \\n\\n \\n\\n(b)  the  conditions  that  resulted  in  the  financial  problem  were  largely \\nbeyond  the  person's  control  (e.g.,  loss  of  employment,  a  business \\ndownturn,  unexpected  medical  emergency,  or  a  death,  divorce  or \\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. \\n\\n \\n\\nAG ¶ 20 (b) would apply if his divorce 11 years ago adversely affected his ability \\nto repay his debts. But he also has to act responsibly under the circumstances. It is his \\nburden  of  proof  to  submit  specific  documents  to  demonstrate  those  actions.  However, \\nhe failed to meet his burden of proof on that issue.  \\n\\n \\nLastly,  Applicant  contends  his  medical  problem  in  2010  caused  some  of  his \\ndelinquent debt. Applicant failed to prove AG ¶ 20 (b) applied because he did not submit \\nsufficient evidence of the conditions that he asserted were beyond his control and that \\nhe  acted  responsibly  in  resolving  his  delinquent  debts  during  the  time  the  debts  were \\naccumulating. \\n\\n \\n\\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \\n\\n \\nAG ¶ 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \\n \\nConduct  involving  questionable  judgment,  lack  of  candor,  dishonesty,  or \\nunwillingness  to  comply  with  rules  and  regulations  can  raise  questions \\nabout  an  individual's  reliability,  trustworthiness  and  ability  to  protect \\nclassified  information.  Of  special  interest  is  any  failure  to  provide  truthful \\nand  candid  answers  during  the  security  clearance  process  or  any  other \\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \\n \\nAG  ¶  16  describes  conditions  that  could  raise  a  security  concern  and  may  be \\n\\ndisqualifying: \\n\\n \\n (c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \\nnot  sufficient  for  an  adverse  determination  under  any  other  single \\nguideline,  but  which,  when  considered  as  a  whole,  supports  a  whole-\\nperson  assessment  of  questionable \\njudgment,  untrustworthiness, \\nunreliability,  lack  of  candor,  unwillingness  to  comply  with  rules  and \\nregulations,  or  other  characteristics  indicating  that  the  person  may  not \\nproperly safeguard protected information; \\n\\n \\n\\n5 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n\n",

Coupled \\nwith his financial debts, Applicant is especially vulnerable to coercion and duress in the \\nhope of extricating himself from his predicament caused by his misconduct and financial \\ndelinquencies.

AG  ¶  17  (c)  is  not \\nestablished.  \\n \\n\\nApplicant has not acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change \\nhis actions or taken other positive steps to show his course of conduct will not recur. AG \\n¶ 17 (d) does not apply.  \\n \\n\\nApplicant  has  not  taken  positive  action  to  reduce  or  eliminate  vulnerability  to \\n\\nexploitation, manipulation, or duress. AG ¶ 17 (e) is not established.  \\n \\n\\nThe information is substantiated in many documents submitted in the Applicant’s \\n\\nfile. AG ¶ 17 (f) is not established.  \\n \\n\\nFinally, there is no allegation that Applicant associated with persons involved with \\ncriminal  activity,  so  AG  ¶17  (g)  is  not  applicable.  Nor  are  the  first  two  mitigating \\nconditions of any applicability because they apply to false statements by any Applicant \\nor failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \\n \\nWhole-Person Concept \\n\\n \\nUnder  the  whole-person  concept,  the  administrative  judge  must  evaluate  an \\napplicant=s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant=s \\nconduct  and  all  relevant  circumstances.  The  administrative  judge  should  consider  the \\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG & 2(a): \\n\\nthe  nature,  extent,  and  seriousness  of \\nto \\n\\n \\nthe \\nthe  conduct;  (2) \\n(1) \\ncircumstances  surrounding \\ninclude  knowledgeable \\nparticipation;  (3)  the  frequency  and  recency  of  the  conduct;  (4)  the \\nindividual=s  age  and  maturity  at  the  time  of  the  conduct;  (5)  the extent to \\nwhich  participation \\nthe  presence  or  absence  of \\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \\nfor  the  conduct;  (8)  the  potential  for  pressure,  coercion,  exploitation,  or \\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \\n \\n\\nthe  conduct, \\n\\nis  voluntary;  (6) \\n\\nUnder AG & 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \\nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.      \\n\\n \\n\\nI  considered  the  potentially  disqualifying  and  mitigating  conditions  in  light  of  all \\nfacts  and  circumstances  surrounding  this  case.  Applicant  was  an  adult  when  he \\nincurred  the  debts.  He  has  not  taken  any  action  supported  by  objective  evidence  to \\n\\n \\n\\n7 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n\n",
       " \\nresolve his delinquent debts. This inaction leaves him vulnerable to pressure, coercion, \\nexploitation,  or  duress  based  on  the  magnitude  of  his  financial  obligation.  His  lack  of \\naction continues to this day, and is obviously voluntary. His inaction will continue based \\non  his  past  performance.  Applicant  displayed  a  lack  of  good  judgment  incurring  the \\ndebts.  Next,  he  exhibited  a  continued  lack  of  appropriate  judgment  by  failing  to  make \\npayments on any of his delinquent debts during the past seven years. \\n\\n \\nApplicant also has a pattern of violations of work standards set by his employer. \\nHe is an inattentive employee who finds it difficult to conform his behavior to the rules \\nand regulations of his employer. His misconduct has been perpetrated over a decade of \\nemployment. \\n\\n \\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or substantial doubts as to \\nApplicant=s  eligibility  and  suitability  for  a  security  clearance.  For  all  these  reasons,  I \\nconclude  Applicant  did  not  mitigate  the  security  concerns  arising  under  the  guidelines \\nfor Financial Considerations and Personal Conduct.  \\n \\n\\nFormal Findings \\n\\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \\n\\n \\n \\nas required by ¶ E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \\n \\n\\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \\n\\n \\n          Subparagraph 1.a to 1.q: \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:   \\n\\nSubparagraphs 2.a to 2.j:   \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nAGAINST APPLICANT \\n\\nAgainst Applicant \\n\\nAGAINST APPLICANT \\n\\nAgainst Applicant \\n\\nConclusion \\n\\n \\n\\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \\nclearly  consistent  with  the  national  interest  to  grant  Applicant  eligibility  for  a  security \\nclearance.

DOD  CAF  acted  under  Executive \\nOrder  (EO)  10865,  Safeguarding  Classified  Information  within  Industry  (February  20, \\n1960),  as  amended;  DOD  Directive  5220.6,  Defense  Industrial  Personnel  Security \\nClearance  Review  Program  (January  2,  1992),  as  amended  (Directive);  and  the \\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on September 1, 2006. \\n\\n \\nApplicant  answered  the  SOR  on  July  14,  2015,  and  elected  to  have  his  case \\ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the \\nGovernment’s File of Relevant Material (FORM) on September 9, 2015. The evidence \\n\\n) \\n) \\n) \\n) \\n) \\n) \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n1 \\n \\n \\n\\n\f",
       "included in the FORM is identified as Items 4-10 and is admitted into the record (Items \\n1-3 are pleadings and transmittal documents). The FORM was mailed to Applicant, who \\nreceived it on October 19, 2015. Applicant was given an opportunity to file objections \\nand submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. He submitted an undated \\nresponse to the FORM, which was admitted without objection as Applicant Exhibit (AE) \\nA. The case was assigned to me on December 21, 2015.  \\n\\nIn Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted all but one of the allegations. The \\nadmissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a careful review of the pleadings and \\nevidence, I make the following additional findings of fact.1 \\n\\n \\nApplicant is 56 years old. He has worked for a defense contractor since 1997. He \\nis divorced and has three children, ages 15, 18, and 20. He has a bachelor’s degree. He \\nhas no military experience.2  \\n \\n \\n \\nApplicant’s conduct raised in the SOR included: a history of consuming alcohol, \\nat times, to excess from 1974 to about April 2014; being found guilty for operating under \\nthe  influence  of  alcohol  (OUI)  in  February  1991;  being  found  guilty  for  OUI  2nd  in \\nNovember 1997; and being found guilty for OUI 3rd in November 2010 (See SOR ¶¶ 1.a \\n- 1.d).3 \\n \\n \\nApplicant  began  drinking  alcohol  when  he  was  approximately  15  years  old  in \\n1974. He drinks beer on most occasions. Even after his OUI convictions, he stated he \\nwas  still  was  consuming  two  to  three  beers  a  week.  He  drinks  in  social  settings  and \\nafter hockey games. As a result of his 2010 OUI conviction, he lost his driver’s license \\nfor five years. He completed his probation in May 2015.4 \\n \\n \\nCourt documents establish that Applicant was found guilty of three OUI offenses, \\nin 1992 (1991 arrest), 2000 (1997 arrest), and 2012 (2010 arrest). He was placed on \\nprobation in each instance.5 \\n \\n \\nIn  February  1991,  Applicant  was  driving  home  from  a  friend’s  house  where  he \\nconsumed  about  four  beers.  He  was  stopped  by  a  police  officer  who  had  observed \\nApplicant’s  car  cross  over  the  center  line.  Applicant  was  given,  and  failed,  a  field \\nsobriety test. He was taken into the police station where he refused a breathalyzer test. \\n                                                           \\n1 Item 2. \\n \\n2 Item 4. \\n \\n3 Items 1, 3. \\n \\n4 Item 10; AE A. \\n \\n5 Item 7, 9; AE A. \\n \\n\\n \\n\\nFindings of Fact \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n2 \\n \\n \\n\\n\f",
       "He was charged with OUI and later pleaded guilty. He was required to attend 12 weeks \\nof alcohol education and counseling classes, which he completed.6 \\n \\n \\nIn November 1997, Applicant was going home from a high school football game \\nwhen he was stopped in traffic by a police officer. Applicant had two beers before the \\ngame  and  shared  a  flask  containing  some  kind  of  alcohol  at  the  game.  The  officer \\napparently  asked  Applicant \\nif  he  had  been  drinking  and  Applicant  answered \\naffirmatively. He was then given field sobriety tests, which he failed. He was arrested, \\ntaken back to the police station and given a breathalyzer test, which he also failed. He \\nwas  found  guilty  of  OUI  and  sentenced  to  two  years’  probation,  loss  of  his  driver’s \\nlicense  for  six  months,  and  12  weeks  required  attendance  at  alcohol  education  and \\ncounseling classes.7 \\n \\n \\nIn  November  2010,  Applicant  was  driving  back  from  a  hockey  tournament  and \\nwas stopped by a state patrolman because he crossed the center line. Applicant had \\nconsumed six beers and shared a flask of whiskey at the hockey tournament. He failed \\nthe  field  sobriety  tests  and  was  almost  incoherent  to  the  patrolman.  He  was  arrested \\nand taken to a police station where he was offered a breathalyzer test. He was unable \\nto properly perform the test, which was deemed a refusal to take the test. He was found \\nguilty of OUI and sentenced to six months’ incarceration, five years of probation, loss of \\ndriver’s  license  for  five  years,  and  mandatory  substance  abuse  evaluation  and \\ntreatment.8 \\n \\nThe court-ordered substance abuse treatment involved two mandatory sessions \\n \\nand  Applicant  voluntarily  attended  six  more  sessions.  He \\nto  provide \\ndocumentation of any evaluation done by the counselors, but Applicant stated he was \\ndiagnosed  as  being  an  alcohol  abuser.  Applicant  also  attended  Alcohol  Anonymous \\n(AA) meetings once every six to eight weeks. He last attended an AA meeting in May \\n2015. He continued to drink an occasional beer every few months. In May 2015, at an \\nAA meeting he heard a story had made him decide to stop drinking alcohol entirely. He \\nclaims he has not had any alcohol since that time.9 \\n \\n\\nfailed \\n\\nfor  a  security  clearance, \\n\\nWhen  evaluating  an  applicant’s  suitability \\n\\n \\nthe \\nadministrative  judge  must  consider  the  adjudicative  guidelines.  In  addition  to  brief \\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \\ndisqualifying  conditions  and  mitigating  conditions,  which  are  used  in  evaluating  an \\napplicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. \\n                                                           \\n6 Item 10. \\n \\n7 Item 10. \\n \\n8 Items 7, 10. \\n \\n9 Item 6-10; AE A. \\n \\n\\nPolicies \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n3 \\n \\n \\n\\n\f",
       "These  guidelines  are  not  inflexible  rules  of  law.  Instead,  recognizing  the \\ncomplexities  of  human  behavior,  these  guidelines  are  applied  in  conjunction  with  the \\nfactors  listed  in  the  adjudicative  process.  The  administrative  judge’s  overarching \\nadjudicative  goal  is  a  fair,  impartial,  and  commonsense  decision.  According  to  AG  ¶ \\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \\nthe  “whole-person  concept.”  The  administrative  judge  must  consider  all  available, \\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \\nmaking a decision. \\n\\n \\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) \\nrequires  that  “[a]ny  doubt  concerning  personnel  being  considered  for  access  to \\nclassified  information  will  be  resolved  in  favor  of  national  security.”  In  reaching  this \\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \\non the evidence contained in the record.  \\n\\n \\nUnder Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \\ncontroverted  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  Under  Directive  ¶  E3.1.15,  an  “applicant  is \\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \\nmitigate  facts  admitted  by  applicant  or  proven  by  Department  Counsel,  and  has  the \\nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.”  \\n\\nthe  Government  predicated  upon \\n\\n \\nA  person  who  seeks  access  to  classified  information  enters  into  a  fiduciary \\nrelationship  with \\ntrust  and  confidence.  This \\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \\nGovernment  reposes  a  high  degree  of  trust  and  confidence  in  individuals  to  whom  it \\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \\nthe  possible  risk  that  an  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  safeguard \\nclassified  information.  Such  decisions  entail  a  certain  degree  of  legally  permissible \\nextrapolation  about  potential,  rather  than  actual,  risk  of  compromise  of  classified \\ninformation. \\n\\n \\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of \\nthe national interest and shall  in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \\napplicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \\n\\nAnalysis \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \\n\\nAG ¶ 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption: \\n\\nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \\njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \\nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \\n\\n \\n4 \\n \\n \\n\\n\f",
       "AG  ¶  22  describes  conditions  that  could  raise  a  security  concern  and  may  be \\n\\ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \\n\\n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \\nthe  influence,  fighting,  child  or  spouse  abuse,  disturbing  the  peace,  or \\nother  incidents  of  concern,  regardless  of  whether  the  individual  is \\ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent;  \\n\\n(c)  habitual  or  binge  consumption  of  alcohol  to  the  point  of  impaired \\njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol \\nabuser or alcohol dependent. \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\nof both disqualifying conditions.  \\n\\nApplicant’s three OUI convictions and his drinking history support the application \\n\\nI  have  also  considered  all  of  the  mitigating  conditions  for  alcohol  consumption \\n\\nunder AG ¶ 23 and found the following relevant: \\n\\n(a)  so  much  time  has  passed,  or  the  behavior  was  so  infrequent,  or  it \\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \\nor good judgment; and \\n\\n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol \\nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \\nhas  established  a  pattern  of  abstinence  (if  alcohol  dependent)  or \\nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser). \\n\\n \\nApplicant’s  last  adverse  alcohol  incident  occurred  in  November  2010  and  he \\ncame  off  probation  for  that  offense  in  May  2015.  His  three  OUI  convictions  are  not \\ninfrequent  under  these  circumstances.  Insufficient  attenuation  exists  to  conclude \\nenough  time  has  passed  since  his  last  alcohol-related  incident.  His  history  of  OUI \\narrests  and  convictions  under  similar  circumstances  suggest  that  recurrence  is  a \\npossibility. His current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment are in doubt. AG ¶ \\n23(a) does not apply. \\n \\nApplicant recently decided to totally abstain from using alcohol. He indicated that \\n \\nhe has abstained since May 2015. While this is a commendable start, it is too soon to \\ndetermine whether his abstinence will continue to be part of his life or whether he will \\nuse alcohol responsibly in the future. AG ¶ 23(b) partially applies.   \\n \\nWhole-Person Concept \\n \\nUnder  the  whole-person  concept,  the  administrative  judge  must  evaluate  an \\n \\napplicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s \\n\\n \\n5 \\n \\n \\n\\n\f",
       "conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  \\n \\n\\nthe  conduct, \\n\\nthe  nature,  extent,  and  seriousness  of \\nto \\n\\n(1) \\nthe  conduct;  (2) \\nthe \\ncircumstances  surrounding \\ninclude  knowledgeable \\nparticipation;  (3)  the  frequency  and  recency  of  the  conduct;  (4)  the \\nindividual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \\nwhich  participation \\nthe  presence  or  absence  of \\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \\nfor  the  conduct;  (8)  the  potential  for  pressure,  coercion,  exploitation,  or \\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \\n \\n\\nis  voluntary;  (6) \\n\\nUnder AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \\nof the guideline and the whole-person concept.        \\n\\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered the circumstances that \\nled  to  his  arrests  and  his  current  state  of  abstinence.  Overall,  the  record  evidence \\nleaves  me  with  questions  and  doubts  as  to  Applicant’s  eligibility  and  suitability  for  a \\nsecurity  clearance.  For  all  these  reasons,  I  conclude  Applicant  failed  to  mitigate  the \\nsecurity concerns under Guideline G. \\n\\nFormal Findings \\n\\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \\n\\n \\n \\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \\n \\n \\n \\n\\nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.d: \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nAgainst Applicant \\n\\nAGAINST APPLICANT \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nConclusion \\n\\n \\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \\nclearly  consistent  with  the  national  interest  to  grant  Applicant  eligibility  for  a  security \\nclearance.

Eligibility  for \\n\\naccess to classified information is granted.  \\n \\n\\nStatement of the Case \\n\\nOn October 28, 2014, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \\nReasons  (SOR)  to  Applicant  detailing  security  concerns  under  Guideline  F,  financial \\nconsiderations. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \\n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \\n1992),  as  amended  (Directive);  and  the  adjudicative  guidelines  (AG)  implemented  by \\nthe DOD on September 1, 2006. \\n\\n \\nApplicant  responded  to  the  SOR  on  November  14,  2014,  and  requested  a \\nhearing  before  an  administrative  judge.  The  case  was  originally  assigned  to  me  on \\nFebruary 27, 2015. Scheduling of the case was delayed because Applicant was working \\noverseas. The case was reassigned to me on May 4, 2015. After coordinating with the \\nparties, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n1 \\n\\n\f",
       "on  July  16,  2015,  scheduling  the  hearing  for  August  18,  2015.  The  hearing  was \\nconvened  as  scheduled.  DOHA  received  the  hearing  transcript  (Tr.)  on  August  26, \\n2015.  \\n \\n\\nEvidentiary Rulings \\n\\nGovernment  Exhibits  (GE)  1,  2,  4,  5,  and  6  were  admitted  in  evidence  without \\nobjection. GE 3 was admitted over Applicant’s objection. Applicant testified, called five \\nwitnesses, and submitted Applicant’s Exhibits (AE) A through Z, which were admitted \\nwithout  objection.  The  record  was  held  open  for  Applicant  to  submit  additional \\ninformation. He submitted documents that I have marked AE AA and BB1 and admitted \\nwithout objection.  \\n \\n\\nFindings of Fact \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\nApplicant is a 57-year-old self-employed contractor for a defense contractor. He \\nserved  in  the  U.S.  military  from  1979  until  he  retired  in  2000.  He  seeks  to  retain  a \\nsecurity clearance, which he has held since he was in the military. He attended college \\nfor a period, but he is a few credits shy of a degree. His first marriage ended in divorce. \\nHe has been married to his current spouse for more than 25 years. He has two adult \\nchildren.2 \\n \\n \\nApplicant spent the majority of his military career in special operations. He went \\non  numerous  combat  missions,  conducted  clandestine  insertions,  and  operated \\nundercover.  When  he  retired  he  became  an  entrepreneur  and  started  his  own \\ncompanies.  His  primary  company  was  incorporated,  but  Applicant  had  to  personally \\nguarantee many of the company’s liabilities. He also invested in real estate. His primary \\ncompany  suffered  significant  setbacks  during  the  recession  and  housing  crisis  of  the \\nlater part of the 2000s. His real estate properties lost much of their value. He closed his \\nprimary  company  in  2009  and  has  been  working  since  then  as  a  self-employed \\ncontractor and subcontractor for other companies. He has spent much of the last five \\nyears working overseas in dangerous assignments.3 \\n \\n  \\nThe SOR alleges nine delinquent debts, which include a $58,161 judgment (SOR \\n¶  1.a),  mortgage  loans  (SOR  ¶  1.c  -  $30,994;  SOR  ¶  1.d  -  $351,562;  SOR  ¶  1.e  - \\n$271,900; and SOR ¶ 1.f - $50,688), two business-related debts (SOR ¶ 1.b - $18,028 \\nand SOR ¶ 1.h - $77,115) and federal taxes (SOR ¶ 1.g - $33,882 for tax year 2008, \\nand SOR ¶ 1.i – no amount alleged for tax years 2012 and 2013). Applicant admitted \\nowing most of the debts at some point, but several of the debts were paid, settled, or \\notherwise resolved. \\n \\n\\n                                                           \\n1  Counsel  marked  the  post-hearing  submissions  as  Z  and  AA,  but  AE  Z  was  already  admitted  at  the \\nhearing.  \\n \\n2 Tr. at 118, 123-127, 184; GE 1, 3 AE A. \\n \\n3 Tr. at 28-31, 120, 127-131; GE 1, 3; AE A, T. \\n\\n \\n2 \\n\\n\f",
       " \\nApplicant’s primary company was growing, and it leased a larger warehouse in \\nabout  2008.  The  business  ultimately  failed,  and  the  company  broke  the  lease.  The \\nowner of the warehouse sued  Applicant  personally  and  obtained a $58,161 judgment \\nagainst  him  (SOR  ¶  1.a).  Applicant’s  attorney  is  negotiating  a  settlement  on  this \\njudgment.4  \\n \\n \\nApplicant and a partner had a falling out over the business. The ex-partner sued \\nApplicant  for  $160,000.  They  reached  a  settlement  through  arbitration  in  which \\nApplicant agreed to pay the ex-partner $163,000 by 2010. He paid about $86,000, but \\nhe  was  unable  to  pay  the  remainder  when  the  company  closed.  The  partner  either \\nobtained  a  judgment  for  $77,000  or  sought  to  enforce  the  arbitrated  settlement. \\nApplicant’s  attorney  is  negotiating  a  settlement  for  the  remainder  owed  to  the  ex-\\npartner.5 \\n \\nIn February 2013, Applicant settled the $20,302 business credit card debt alleged \\n \\nin  SOR  ¶  1.b  (alleged  as  $18,028  in  SOR)  for  $10,151,  which  was  paid  in  February \\n2013. Applicant submitted proof in his response to DOHA interrogatories in May 2014 \\nthat the debt had been settled. The February 2014 credit report lists the account with a \\nzero balance, with the annotation that it was transferred, sold, and paid.6 \\n \\n \\nApplicant was due a refund from his 2007 federal income taxes, but he owed the \\nIRS for tax year 2008. The IRS filed a $33,882 tax lien against Applicant in June 2010 \\n(SOR ¶ 1.g). In January 2011, the IRS applied his $15,892 refund from his 2007 taxes \\nto his 2008 taxes. Applicant paid the remaining $5,689 owed for 2008 in January 2013. \\nThe  2014  credit  reports  obtained  by  the  Government  report  the  lien  as  released  in \\nJanuary 2013.7 \\n \\n \\nApplicant owed the IRS $65,863 for his 2012 and 2013 federal income taxes. In \\nApril  2015,  he  submitted  a  proposed  installment  agreement  to  the  IRS  whereby  he \\nwould  pay  an  initial  $915  and  then  $500  per  month  until  paid.  In  July  2015,  the  IRS \\naccepted  Applicant’s  installment  agreement  and  added  his  2014  taxes.  On  June  5, \\n2015,  Applicant  paid  the  IRS  $56,415  for  his  2014  taxes.  On  July  9,  2015,  he  paid \\n$10,000 toward his estimated taxes for 2015.8 \\n \\n \\nApplicant used to own five properties consisting of his residence and four rental \\nproperties. Some of his tenants did not pay their rent, and he also had a property vacant \\nfor an extended period. Applicant bought his home and another property when he was \\nin the military. He still has those properties, plus another, but he lost two properties to \\nforeclosure.

He credibly testified that it will \\ntake time, but he is committed to resolving all his debts.14  \\n \\n \\nApplicant’s character evidence was extraordinary.

His former commanding officer testified that he served \\nwith  Applicant  under  conditions  that  the  commanding  officer  modesty  described  as \\n“quite  stressful.”  The  endorsements  of  the  witnessses  and  authors  were  unequivocal \\nand exceptional.15 \\n \\n\\nPolicies \\n\\n \\n\\nWhen  evaluating  an  applicant’s  suitability \\n\\n \\nthe \\nadministrative  judge  must  consider  the  adjudicative  guidelines.  In  addition  to  brief \\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \\ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \\napplicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. \\n \\n\\nfor  a  security  clearance, \\n\\nThese  guidelines  are  not  inflexible  rules  of  law.  Instead,  recognizing  the \\ncomplexities  of  human  behavior,  administrative  judges  apply  the  guidelines  in \\nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s \\noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \\nto  AG  ¶  2(c),  the  entire  process  is  a  conscientious  scrutiny  of  a  number  of  variables \\nknown  as  the  “whole-person  concept.”  The  administrative  judge  must  consider  all \\navailable,  reliable  information  about  the  person,  past  and  present,  favorable  and \\nunfavorable, in making a decision. \\n\\n \\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) \\nrequires  that  “[a]ny  doubt  concerning  personnel  being  considered  for  access  to \\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.”  \\n\\n \\nUnder Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \\ncontroverted  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  Under  Directive  ¶  E3.1.15,  the  applicant  is \\nresponsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \\nor  mitigate  facts  admitted  by  the  applicant  or  proven  by  Department  Counsel.”  The \\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \\n\\nthe  Government  predicated  upon \\n\\n \\nA  person  who  seeks  access  to  classified  information  enters  into  a  fiduciary \\n \\nrelationship  with \\ntrust  and  confidence.  This \\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \\nGovernment  reposes  a  high  degree  of  trust  and  confidence  in  individuals  to  whom  it \\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \\nthe  possible  risk  the  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  safeguard \\nclassified  information.  Such  decisions  entail  a  certain  degree  of  legally  permissible \\n                                                           \\n14 Tr. at 50, 180-181, 190-193, 197; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 3 ; AE A, U, W, Y. \\n \\n15 Tr. at 25-28, 50-51, 62-74; AE B-L, T. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n5 \\n\\n\f",

The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \\n\\n \\n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \\n\\n \\n\\n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\nevidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions.  \\n \\n  \\nprovided under AG ¶ 20.

Additionally, the SOR alleged the high credit on the two \\nmortgage  loans  (SOR  ¶¶  1.d  -  $351,562  and  1.e  -  $271,900),  when  the  balances  on \\nthose loans were reported as zero.  \\n \\n  \\nApplicant paid his 2008 federal income taxes. He has a payment plan in place for \\nhis  2012  and  2013  tax  years.  He  settled  and  paid  the  second  mortgage  loan  on  his \\nhome,  and  he  paid  other  debts  that  were  not  alleged  in  the  SOR.  His  attorney  is \\nnegotiating  settlements  for  the  two  judgments  against  him.  Applicant  credibly  testified \\nthat it will take time, but he is committed to resolving all his debts. \\n \\n \\nI find that Applicant established a plan to resolve his financial problems, and he \\ntook significant action to implement that plan. He acted responsibly and made a good-\\nfaith effort to pay his debts. There are clear indications that his financial problems are \\nbeing  resolved  and  are  under  control.  They  occurred  under  circumstances  that  are \\nunlikely  to  recur  and  do  not  cast  doubt  on  his  current  reliability,  trustworthiness,  and \\ngood judgment. AG ¶¶ 20(c) and 20(d) are applicable. AG ¶ 20(b) is partially applicable. \\nAG ¶ 20(a) is not yet completely applicable because Applicant is still in the process of \\npaying his debts.  \\n \\nWhole-Person Concept \\n \\nUnder  the  whole-person  concept,  the  administrative  judge  must  evaluate  an \\n \\napplicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s \\nconduct  and  all  relevant  circumstances.  The  administrative  judge  should  consider  the \\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nthe  conduct, \\n\\nthe  nature,  extent,  and  seriousness  of \\nto \\n\\nthe  conduct;  (2) \\nthe \\n(1) \\ncircumstances  surrounding \\ninclude  knowledgeable \\nparticipation;  (3)  the  frequency  and  recency  of  the  conduct;  (4)  the \\nindividual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \\nwhich  participation \\nthe  presence  or  absence  of \\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \\nfor  the  conduct;  (8)  the  potential  for  pressure,  coercion,  exploitation,  or \\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \\n\\nis  voluntary;  (6) \\n\\n \\n7 \\n\\n\f",
       " \\nUnder AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \\nsecurity  clearance  must  be  an  overall  commonsense  judgment  based  upon  careful \\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \\n \\n\\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions  in  light  of  all \\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.

His  financial  problems  are \\nlarge, but not insurmountable. Applicant credibly testified that he will eventually resolve \\nall his debts.

The motion to amend was granted.2 \\n \\n\\nFindings of Fact \\n\\n \\n \\nApplicant is a 40-year-old mechanic who works as a quality assurance inspector \\nfor  a  defense  contractor.  He  has  been  working  for  that  contractor  in  the  Middle  East \\nsince May 2011 and has worked overseas for other defense contractors for a number of \\nyears.  He  earned  a  general  educational  development  certificate  in  1996  and  an \\nassociate’s degree in 2003. He has been married twice. He married his current wife in \\n2005. He has three children, ages 15, 16, and 22.3 \\n \\n\\nExcluding  the  withdrawn  allegations,  the  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  had  three \\ndelinquent  debts  totaling  $64,168  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.c).  In  his  Answer  to  the  SOR,  he \\ndenied each debt. Substantial evidence of the alleged debts is contained in GE 1-4.4  \\n\\n \\nIn 1999, Applicant was involved in a car accident and incurred a broken pelvis \\nand hip. He was determined to be fully disabled and collected about $1,000 per month \\nin disability payments from the Social Security Administration (SSA). While receiving the \\ndisability benefits, he knew there was a limit on how much income he could earn, but \\ndid not know the exact restrictions. In 2006, he received a letter from SSA that indicated \\n                                                           \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n1 Tr. 23-25.  \\n\\n2 Tr. 43-44.  \\n\\n3 Tr. 5-7, 23, 37-39, 42-43; GE 1. \\n\\n4 GE 1-4; Applicant’s Answer to the SOR.  \\n\\n \\n2 \\n \\n \\n\\n\f",
       "he was earning more income than he was allowed. At that time, his disability payments \\nstopped, and he has not received any further disability payments since then.5 \\n\\n \\nA credit report dated June 12, 2010, reflected that Applicant’s SSA account had \\nbeen  placed  for  collection  in  the  amount  of  $20,955  (SOR  ¶  1.c).  This  delinquent \\naccount was the result of his overpayment of disability payments. In 2008, he started \\nrepaying this debt through a monthly pay allotment of $300. When he left his job later \\nthat year, the allotment stopped. In 2012, the SSA began garnishing his pay at a rate of \\n$600 every two weeks. By early 2014 (well before the issuance of the SOR), he fully \\nrepaid this debt. In July 2014, he received a letter from the SSA stating he overpaid the \\ndebt and would be receiving a refund of $2,535.6 \\n\\n \\nIn 2008 and 2009, Applicant worked overseas, and a portion of his income was \\nexempt from taxation. In those years, his income was greater than the exemption, and \\nhe incurred taxes that he could not pay. In his security clearance application (SCA), he \\ndisclosed that he owed approximately $36,000 to the IRS for 2008 and 2009 (SOR ¶ \\n1.b). In 2010, his state also filed a $7,213 tax lien against him (SOR ¶ 1.a).7 \\n\\n \\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant stated that the state tax lien had been repaid \\nthrough monthly payroll deductions. He also stated that he had a repayment plan with \\nthe IRS and the payments are automatically deducted from his pay.8  \\n\\n  \\nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that the state tax lien was repaid, but he had \\nnot  yet  received  a  document  from  the  state  showing  it  was  paid.  He  stated  that  the \\ndeductions from his pay for the state tax lien stopped over a year ago. At the hearing, \\nhe also provided IRS account transcripts for 2008 and 2009 that showed he had been \\nconsistently  making  monthly  payments  of  $375  since  August  2012.  As  of  September \\n2015,  his  IRS  account  balance  for  2008  was  $3,961  and  for  2009  was  $17,124.

       "Policies \\n\\n \\n\\nThe  President  of  the  United  States  has  the  authority  to  control  access  to \\ninformation  bearing  on  national  security  and  to  determine  whether  an  individual  is \\nsufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. Department of the Navy v. \\nEgan,  484  U.S.  518,  527  (1988).  The  President  has  authorized  the  Secretary  of \\nDefense to grant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it \\nis clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \\nClassified  Information  within  Industry  §  2  (Feb.  20,  1960),  as  amended.  The  U.S. \\nSupreme  Court  has  recognized  the  substantial  discretion  of  the  Executive  Branch  in \\nregulating  access  to  information  pertaining  to  national  security,  emphasizing  that  “no \\none  has  a  ‘right’  to  a  security  clearance.”  Department  of  the  Navy  v.  Egan,  484  U.S. \\n518, 528 (1988). \\n\\n \\nEligibility  for  a  security  clearance  is  predicated  upon  the  applicant  meeting  the \\ncriteria  contained  in  the  adjudicative  guidelines.  These  AGs  are  not  inflexible  rules  of \\nlaw.  Instead,  recognizing  the  complexities  of  human  behavior,  these  guidelines  are \\napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s \\nadjudicative  goal  is  a  fair,  impartial,  and  commonsense  decision.  An  administrative \\njudge  must  consider  all  available,  reliable  information  about  the  person,  past  and \\npresent, favorable and unfavorable, in reaching a decision.  \\n\\n \\nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \\naccess  to  classified  information.  This  relationship  transcends  normal  duty  hours  and \\nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \\npossible  risk  that  the  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  safeguard \\nclassified  information.  Such  decisions  entail  a  certain  degree  of  legally  permissible \\nextrapolation  of  potential,  rather  than  actual,  risk  of  compromise  of  classified \\ninformation. Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in \\nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. \\nOr.  10865  §  7.  See  also  Executive  Order  12968  (Aug.  2,  1995),  Section  3.  Thus,  a \\nclearance  decision  is  merely  an  indication  that  the  Applicant  has  or  has  not  met  the \\nstrict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing \\na clearance. \\n\\n \\nInitially,  the  Government  must  establish,  by  substantial  evidence,  conditions  in \\nthe  personal  or  professional  history  of  the  applicant  that  may  disqualify  the  applicant \\nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \\nof  establishing  controverted  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  See  Egan,  484  U.S.  at  531.  \\n“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. \\nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \\npresume  a  nexus  or  rational  connection  between  proven  conduct  under  any  of  the \\ncriteria listed and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \\n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n4 \\n \\n \\n\\n\f",
       "Once  the  Government  establishes  a  disqualifying  condition  by  substantial \\nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \\nfacts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \\nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue [his or her] security \\nclearance.”  ISCR  Case  No.  01-20700  at  3  (App.  Bd.  Dec.  19,  2002).  The  burden  of \\ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. \\n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \\nif they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   \\n\\nAnalysis \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \\n\\n \\nThe security concern for this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 18 as follows: \\n\\n \\n\\nFailure  or  inability  to  live  within  one’s  means,  satisfy  debts,  and  meet \\nfinancial  obligations  may  indicate  poor  self-control,  lack  of  judgment,  or \\nunwillingness  to  abide  by  rules  and  regulations,  all  of  which  can  raise \\nquestions  about  an  individual’s  reliability,  trustworthiness  and  ability  to \\nprotect  classified \\nfinancially \\noverextended  is  at  risk  of  having  to  engage  in  illegal  acts  to  generate \\nfunds.  \\n \\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \\n\\ninformation.  An \\n\\nindividual  who \\n\\nis \\n\\nAG ¶ 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \\n\\n \\n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and  \\n\\n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nThe  evidence  established  that  Applicant  accumulated  delinquent  debts  that  he \\nwas unable or unwilling to pay for an extended period. AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) apply in \\nthis case. \\n \\n \\napplicable:  \\n \\n\\nFour financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially \\n\\n(a)  the  behavior  happened  so  long  ago,  was  so  infrequent,  or  occurred \\nunder  such  circumstances  that  it  is  unlikely  to  recur  and  does  not  cast \\ndoubt  on  the  individual’s  current  reliability,  trustworthiness,  or  good \\njudgment; \\n \\n(b)  the  conditions  that  resulted  in  the  financial  problem  were  largely \\nbeyond  the  person’s  control  (e.g.,  loss  of  employment,  a  business \\ndownturn,  unexpected  medical  emergency,  or  a  death,  divorce  or \\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \\n\\n \\n5 \\n \\n \\n\\n\f",
       "(c)  the  person  has  received  or  is  receiving  counseling  for  the  problem \\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \\nunder control; and \\n \\n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \\notherwise resolve debts.  \\n \\nApplicant  incurred  delinquent  debts  because  he  continued  to  receive  disability \\nbenefits  after  his  income  exceeded  earning  limitations  and  because  he  failed  to  pay \\ntaxes  on  income  earned  in  2008  and  2009.  These  events  do  not  constitute \\ncircumstances beyond his control. AG ¶ 20(b) does not apply. \\n\\n \\nApplicant  has  resolved  the  state  tax  lien  in  SOR  ¶  1.a  and  the  disability \\noverpayment  in  SOR  ¶  1.c.  He  has  established  a  repayment  plan  to  resolve  the \\ndelinquent  federal  taxes  in  SOR  ¶  1.b.  He  has  been  consistently  making  payments \\nunder  that  plan  for  the  past  three  years.  The  record  established  that  his  financial \\nproblems  are  under  control  and  are  being  resolved.  He  has  not  incurred  any  recent \\ndelinquent debts. His financial problems are unlikely to recur and do not cast doubt on \\nhis current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(c), and 20(d) \\napply. \\n\\n \\n\\nWhole-Person Concept \\n\\nIn  the  adjudication  process,  an  administrative  judge  must  carefully  weigh  a \\nnumber  of  variables  known  as  the  whole-person  concept.  Available  information  about \\nthe applicant as well as the factors listed in AG ¶ 2(a) should be considered in reaching \\na  determination.11  In  this  case,  I  gave  due  consideration  to  the  information  about \\nApplicant in the record and concluded the favorable information, including the mitigating \\nevidence,  outweigh  the  security  concerns  at  issue.

(Tr.  178-179,  235;  AE  A)  After  1982, \\nApplicant worked on a variety of Navy contracts for Company D.  Sometimes he was \\nemployed at Company D, but detailed to work on Company L managed projects.

       "In 1999, Applicant was one of the architects of a program for a simulation test of \\npart of a weapons system developed by Company L by utilizing unclassified data. (Tr. \\n184;  GE  5;  GE  6)  From  1999  to  2007,  Applicant  was  instrumental  in  the  program \\ndevelopment. (Tr. 184-189). In November 2007, Applicant went to the Pentagon, and in \\nthe  presence  of  an  admiral,  was  shown  some  design  charts,  which  Applicant  had \\ndeveloped on behalf of Company D, and Company L had previously presented without \\nauthorization to the Navy. (Tr. 189) Applicant believed the information was improperly \\ntaken from Company D by Company L.  \\n\\n \\n\\nHandling Protected Information and Personal Conduct1  \\n\\n \\nApplicant was the leader of a team of technicians working on a Navy project. (Tr. \\n99; GE 5 at 1-2) On about 75 occasions over several years, Company L employees or \\nNavy personnel provided “trusted downloads” on flash drives or compact discs, which \\nwere supposed to be unclassified data or software that Applicant and his team could \\nuse  for  analysis.  (Tr.  94,  99-103;  GE  6  at  7)  Technicians  were  concerned  that  a  file \\nmarked  unclassified  might  actually  contain  classified  data.  (Tr.  87)  The  only  way \\nclassified information could be placed on unclassified computers was through an error \\nin  the  trusted-download  process,  or  a  deliberate  improper  transfer  of  classified \\ninformation. (Tr. 78) Applicant was not authorized to make a trusted download, and he \\ndenied knowingly transferring classified information to an unclassified computer. (Tr. 78)  \\nThere are eight or nine people that could have been responsible for entering data that \\nwas too close to the thresholds to be unclassified. (Tr. 214) \\n\\n \\nApplicant’s team’s project utilized a classified version and an unclassified version \\nof a computer program. The classified version used “a set of parameters, thresholds, \\nwhich [were] put together along with the executable part of the program” to generate a \\n“classified  result.”  (Tr.  100,  107)  The  classified  numbers  changed  as  the  project \\nadvanced.  (Tr.  122-123)  M  was  a  key  person  in  deciding  whether  data  should  be \\nclassified or not. (Tr. 128) The unclassified version of the program used numbers that \\nwere not representative of the real system to simulate interactions, which allowed use of \\nlaptops and communications in an unclassified environment and improved productivity. \\n(Tr. 100-101, 107) The non-representative numbers were used “to test the mechanics of \\nthe  program”  and  debug  problems  in  an  unclassified  environment.  (Tr.  108)  The \\nclassified numbers were not supposed to be used on unclassified computers. (Tr. 112) \\nM assumed the computer he was issued was from Company L and not from DOD. (Tr. \\n113) The unclassified versions could be used at home. (Tr. 100-102) Employees were \\nallowed to use company-issued computers for some personal use; however, extensive \\npersonal use was discouraged. (Tr. 124) At Company L, if a spillage was discovered, \\nCompany L’s facility security officer (FSO) was supposed to be notified. (Tr. 115) The \\nFSO was responsible for ensuring the file was deleted from computers. (Tr. 116) After \\ndeletion of the file, security used a cleaning program to scramble the computer memory. \\n\\n                                            \\n\\n1Unless stated otherwise, the source for the information in this section is a December 16, 2010, \\nletter from an FBI special agent written to the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) about \\nthe investigation of Applicant for unauthorized removal and retention of classified documents or material \\nin possible violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1924.

       "(Tr.  116)  Applicant  had  access  to  classified  versions  of  the  program  and  classified \\nprogram data. (Tr. 118) \\n\\n \\nEmployees  of  Companies  D  and  L  sought  to  maintain  separation  between  the \\nclassified  and  unclassified  versions.  (Tr.  101,  106-108)  In  2008,  the  security  people \\ninterviewed employees and borrowed computers with the programs on their computers \\nto check for a data spill. (Tr. 102) Security found files containing classified information \\non the computers of four to seven employees of Company L, including on M’s computer. \\n(Tr.  102-103,  118-121)  Security  performed  cleansing  operations  on  the  computers  to \\neliminate  the  files  with  classified  information.  (Tr.  102-103,  118-121)  Because  of  the \\nspillage,  the  whole  unclassified-simulation  program  was  terminated,  and  all  future \\nsimulation work was done on the classified side. (Tr. 119, 124) Team members worked \\non  different  areas  of  the  program.  (Tr.  104-105)  Their  work  would  be  subsequently \\nmerged,  which  could  cause  classified  data  to  be  unknowingly  transferred  from  one \\ncomputer to another, and no one would know the origin of the classified information.

(Tr.  221;  GE  5;  GE  6)  The \\ninformation was supposed to unclassified. Classified files from downloads were labeled \\nwith a C, and unclassified files from trusted downloads were labeled with a T for test. \\n(Tr. 192) In December 2007, B, a GS-13, who was the senior Navy employee on the \\nteam,  was  at  Applicant’s  residence,  when  they  were  doing  some computer  work.  (Tr. \\n92, 192) Applicant inserted a flash drive into B’s laptop computer and was surprised to \\nsee a file starting with a C, which meant the file could be classified. (Tr. 193, 217-218; \\nGE 5 at 2) Applicant had previously transferred the data from the flash drive to his DOD-\\nissued laptop computer without noticing the C-file. (Tr. 217) Applicant and B reviewed \\nthe content of the C-file and determined it was too “inchoate” and lacked a specification \\nto  be  classified.  (Tr.  193)  Nothing  inside  the  C-file  was  marked  classified,  and  the \\ncontent of the C-file never made it into a specification. (Tr. 193-194)  \\n\\n \\nIn  December  2007,  the  information  from  the  flash  drive  would  have  been \\nclassified; however, by 2015, it was clear that at most it was sensitive information. (Tr. \\n194, 220; GE 5 at 2) In 2007, the classification level for the data found on Applicant’s \\ncomputer  was  probably  confidential.  (GE  6 at  4)  B  and  Applicant  agreed  that  the file \\nshould be deleted, and B suggested that Applicant download a cleaning program to be \\nsure  it  was  deleted.  (Tr.  193;  GE  4  at  2;  GE  6  at  2)  They  deleted  the  file.  (Tr.  162) \\nApplicant obtained a cleaning program, which wipes out inactive files. (Tr. 195-196)2 It \\ndeletes files from the recycle bin. (Tr. 224) Applicant conceded it was bad judgment to \\ndelete  the  file  without  going  to  security.  (Tr.  195,  235)  Applicant  has  never  had  any \\nsecurity violations. (Tr. 195) Applicant did not disclose the possible transfer of classified \\ninformation  to  an  unclassified  system  until  August  19,  2010  when  he  met  with  an \\n                                            \\n\\n2Applicant is not the only team member with a clearing program on his DOD-issued computer.

(Tr. 214)   \\n\\n \\nOn January 18, 2008, two employees of a rival defense contractor (Company L) \\ntold investigators that Applicant may be responsible for the unauthorized removal and \\nretention of classified materials. (GE 4) \\n\\n \\nOn  January  28,  2008,  Company  D’s  FSO  called  Applicant  and  asked  him  to \\nprovide his two DOD-issued laptop computers to Company L. (Tr. 196, 229) One of the \\nrequested laptop computers was at Applicant’s home. (Tr. 197-199) The FSO did not \\nexplain why the computers were requested. (Tr. 199) Applicant said he would bring the \\ncomputers the next day, and the FSO did not insist or demand that Applicant provide \\nthe computer sooner. (GE 6 at 6) Applicant did not believe there had been classified \\ninformation on the laptop computers. (Tr. 200) Applicant said he deleted  some family \\npictures and other personal information that he did not want to release. (Tr. 139-140, \\n162-163,  169-170,  202,  227-229)  On  January  29,  2008,  Applicant  turned  in  the  two \\nlaptop computers. (GE 6 at 2) \\n\\n \\nIn  early  February  2008,  Applicant  went  to  another  state  where  there  was  a \\ncomputer  with  the  same  program.  Two  subject  matter  experts  (SMEs),  who  were \\nassociated with Applicant’s team, reviewed the “unclassified data” on the hard drive and \\ndetermined  that  there was  probably  classified  data  on  the  computer.  (Tr.  76-77,  205, \\n213;  GE  6  at  2-3)  Most  of  the  information  was  unclassified;  however,  the  classified \\ninformation  was  one  table  of  numbers  or  parameters,  and  none  of  the  SMEs  were \\naware  of  how  the  classified  table  had  migrated  from  the  classified  system  to  the \\nunclassified  system.  (Tr.  77,  88,  90,  213,  232-233)  In  February  2008,  Applicant \\ncontacted Company D’s FSO and advised her of the possibility of confidential data on \\nteam computers. The computers were collected to detect any spillage. (Tr. 205-206; GE \\n6 at 4) One of the SMEs also contacted his FSO about the possible spillage. (Tr. 206)   \\n\\n \\nApplicant  consulted  a  Navy  captain,  who  advised  Applicant  to  seek  the \\nassistance of counsel, and in February 2008, he hired a counsel with significant national \\nsecurity  experience.  (Tr.  203;  GE  5  at  2;  GE  6  at  4;  AE  M)  On  March  4,  2008, \\nApplicant’s  counsel  disclosed  to  the  FBI  that  Applicant  deleted  the  Company  D \\nproprietary files because Company L had requested the computers. (AE B at 2-3)  \\n\\n \\nAfter receipt of the first two computers, the Naval Criminal Investigative Service \\n(NCIS)  and  FBI  wanted  to  check  a  laptop  computer  and  a  desk  top  computer  in \\nApplicant’s  possession  for  spillage.  NCIS  requested  the  two  computers  in  February \\n2008. (Tr. 141; AE B) Applicant had saved tax returns and other personal information on \\nthe  desktop  computer.  The  desk  top  computer  was  obsolete  and  lacked  sufficient \\ncomputer  power  to  run  simulations,  and  Applicant  believed  it  had  no  risk  of  having \\nclassified data on it. (Tr. 210) Applicant’s attorney wanted to find out whether the two \\ncomputers were owned by Applicant, Company D, or DOD before providing them to the \\nFBI  or  NCIS.  (Tr.  141)  With  the  assistance  of  Company  D,  Applicant’s  attorney \\ndetermined  the  two  computers  were  probably  owned  by  DOD.

(Tr. 228-230) Applicant deleted the Company D proprietary information. (Tr. 228-\\n232) Applicant’s attorney disclosed to the FBI that she had retained a copy of the hard \\ndrive of the desktop computer in her office safe. (Tr. 144; AE B) The FBI never asked \\nfor the copy of the hard drive.

(Tr. 80) \\n\\n \\nOn August 19, 2010, Applicant and his counsel met with an AUSA and others for \\na proffer session.

(Tr. \\n156-159,  210,  212)  The  discs  were  marked  unclassified.  (Tr.  210)  Applicant  also \\ndisclosed  he  had  the  flash  drive  that  contained  the  C-file  that  he  downloaded  on  his \\ncomputer in December 2007. (Tr. 222) He had previously deleted the C-file off of the \\nflash drive. (Tr. 224) On August 23, 2010, Applicant provided the requested compact \\ndiscs and flash drive to the NCIS.

(Tr.  150;  AE  C)  The  forensic  examination  determined  that  classified \\nmaterials had been stored on one of the laptop computers. FBI SMEs, who were not \\nrelated to Applicant’s team, reviewed the “classified values” and concluded 11 values \\nwere not sufficiently scrambled to render them unclassified. (Tr. 213; GE 3; GE 5 at 3; \\nAE P) The classification level was deemed to be confidential. (AE L; AE P) Applicant \\nbelieved the FBI SMEs erred in the manner that some of the numbers were “reverse \\nengineered”  and  classified  as  confidential  or  secret.  (GE  6  at  5)  The  FBI  had  been \\nrelying  on  erroneous  information  from  SMEs,  and  the  FBI  SMEs  had  mistakenly \\nconfused some of the unclassified testing numbers with classified data. (Tr. 151, 154, \\n211; GE 3) Applicant agreed with the FBI that one table contained classified numbers. \\n(Tr.  151-154;  GE  5  at  2-3)  Applicant  conceded  his  unclassified  computer  should  not \\nhave  been  used  for  classified  information  because  it  did  not  contain  the  security \\nmeasures required for storage of classified material. (Tr. 155-156)  \\n\\n \\nThe AUSA appeared to accept that Applicant was involved in an inadvertent spill \\nof  classified  numbers  as  opposed  to  a  deliberate  attempt  to  compromise  classified \\ninformation. (Tr. 152) On December 16, 2010, an FBI special agent wrote the Defense \\nIndustrial  Security  Clearance  Office  (DISCO)  about  the  investigation  of  Applicant  for \\nunauthorized  removal  and  retention  of  classified  documents  or  material  in  possible \\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 1924.

As  Commander  in  Chief,  the  President  has  the \\nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \\nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. \\nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \\napplicant’s  eligibility  for  access  to  classified  information  “only  upon  a  finding  that  it  is \\nclearly  consistent  with  the  national  interest  to  do  so.”  Exec.  Or.  10865,  Safeguarding \\nClassified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  \\n \\n\\nEligibility  for  a  security  clearance  is  predicated  upon  the  applicant  meeting  the \\ncriteria  contained  in  the  revised  adjudicative  guidelines.  These  guidelines  are  not \\ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \\nguidelines  are  applied  in  conjunction  with  an  evaluation  of  the  whole  person.  An \\nadministrative \\nimpartial,  and \\ncommonsense  decision.  An  administrative  judge  must  consider  all  available,  reliable \\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \\n\\njudge’s  overarching  adjudicative  goal \\n\\n  \\nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \\naccess  to  classified  information.  This  relationship  transcends  normal  duty  hours  and \\nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \\npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \\nabout  potential,  rather  than  actual,  risk  of  compromise  of  classified  information. \\nClearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \\n\\nis  a \\n\\nfair, \\n\\n \\n8 \\n                                         \\n \\n\\n\f",
       "a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. \\nThis decision is not based, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination \\nabout applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. Thus, any decision to deny a security \\nclearance  is  merely  an  indication  the  applicant  has  not  met  the  strict  guidelines  the \\nPresident and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  \\n\\n \\n \\nInitially,  the  Government  must  establish,  by  substantial  evidence,  conditions  in \\nthe  personal  or  professional  history  of  the  applicant  that  may  disqualify  the  applicant \\nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \\nof  establishing  controverted  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  See  Egan,  484  U.S.  at  531. \\n“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. \\nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \\npresume  a  nexus  or  rational  connection  between  proven  conduct  under  any  of  the \\ncriteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \\nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \\n \\n\\nOnce  the  Government  establishes  a  disqualifying  condition  by  substantial \\nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \\nfacts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \\nis  clearly  consistent  with  the  national  interest  to  grant  or  continue  his  security \\nclearance.”  ISCR  Case  No.  01-20700  at  3  (App.  Bd.

       "Further analysis concerning applicability of mitigating conditions is required. The \\nAppeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving the applicability \\nof mitigating conditions as follows:  \\n\\n \\nOnce  a  concern  arises  regarding  an  Applicant’s  security  clearance \\neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \\nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \\nCir.  1990),  cert.  denied,  499  U.S.  905  (1991).  After  the  Government \\npresents  evidence  raising  security  concerns,  the  burden  shifts  to  the \\napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The \\nstandard  applicable  in  security  clearance  decisions  is  that  articulated  in \\nEgan,  supra.  “Any  doubt  concerning  personnel  being  considered  for \\naccess  to  classified  information  will  be  resolved  in  favor  of  the  national \\nsecurity.” Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b).  \\n \\n\\nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd.

Law enforcement, security officials, and his witnesses are well aware of \\nhis  security-related  conduct,  and he  is not  vulnerable  to  exploitation, manipulation,  or \\nduress because of his security-related conduct. \\n\\n \\nAG ¶¶ 17(c) and 17(d) apply. The only evidence of Applicant’s December 2007 \\nsecurity breach was Applicant’s self-report; however, his self-report was not timely, as it \\nappears  it  was  disclosed  at  his  August  19,  2010  AUSA  proffer.  However,  Applicant’s \\nfailure to report the December 2007 security breach is not recent; the security breach \\nwas  inadvertent;  “it  happened  under  such  unique  circumstances  that  it  is  unlikely  to \\nrecur;”  and  it  “does  not  cast  doubt  on  Applicant’s  reliability,  trustworthiness,  or  good \\njudgment.”  He  admitted  that  he  showed  poor  judgment  in  December  2007  when  he \\ndiscovered that he had downloaded possible classified information onto B’s computer \\nand his own computer, and he failed to report this security breach to his FSO (SOR ¶ \\n\\n \\n11 \\n                                         \\n \\n\\n\f",

Security  needed  to  assess  the  scope  of  the  breach  of  security  or  spillage,  and \\nsecurity was unable to check other computers and determine who was responsible for \\nthe “trusted download” that caused the security breach.  \\n\\n \\nApplicant  understands  the  importance  of  informing  security  of  any  security \\nbreach or possible security breach, and I am confident he will timely disclosed required \\ninformation. Personal conduct concerns are mitigated. Even if security concerns are not \\nmitigated under Guideline E, they are mitigated under the whole-person concept, infra. \\n \\nHandling Protected Information  \\n \\n  \\nAG  ¶  33  articulates  the  security  concern  relating  to  handling  protected \\ninformation  as  follows,  “Deliberate  or  negligent  failure  to  comply  with  rules  and \\nregulations for protecting classified or other sensitive information raises doubt about an \\nindividual’s trustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or willingness and ability to safeguard \\nsuch information, and is a serious security concern.” \\n\\n \\nAG  ¶  34  provides  three  disqualifying  conditions  that  could  raise  a  security \\n\\n  \\nconcern and may be disqualifying in this case:  \\n \\n\\n(b) collecting or storing classified or other protected information at home or \\nin any other unauthorized location; \\n \\n(c) loading, drafting, editing, modifying, storing, transmitting, or otherwise \\nhandling classified reports, data, or other information on any unapproved \\nequipment including but not limited to any typewriter, word processor, or \\ncomputer  hardware,  software,  drive,  system,  gameboard,  handheld, \\n\"palm\" or pocket device or other adjunct equipment; and \\n \\n(g) any failure to comply with rules for the protection of classified or other \\nsensitive information. \\n\\n \\n\\nAG ¶¶ 34(b), 34(c), and 34(g) apply. These three disqualifying conditions do not \\ninclude  a  requirement  that  Applicant  knew  he  was  downloading  classified  information \\nonto  an  unclassified  system,  and  they  do  not  require  that  he  be  aware  that  his \\nunclassified computer systems contain classified information.  \\n\\n \\nSOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.c discussed previously are cross-alleged under SOR ¶¶ 2.a \\nand  2.c.  In  December  2007,  Applicant  discovered  that  he  had  downloaded  possible \\nclassified  information  onto  B’s  computer  and  his  own  computer.  The  two  computers \\nwere not authorized for storage of classified information.   \\n\\n \\nThe hard drive of one of Applicant’s DOD-issued laptop computers was restricted \\nto unclassified information use, and a forensic evaluation and SME review found that his \\nlaptop computer contained some data classified at the confidential level. Applicant was \\nunaware  this  computer  contained  classified  information.  He  is  not  responsible  for \\n\\n \\n12 \\n                                         \\n \\n\\n\f",
       "“trusted  downloads,”  and  he  inadvertently  downloaded  classified  information  from  a \\ntrusted download onto his hard drive.  \\n\\n \\nThree mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 35 are potentially applicable:  \\n\\n \\n\\n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior, or it has happened so \\ninfrequently  or  under  such  unusual  circumstances,  that  it  is  unlikely  to \\nrecur  and  does  not  cast  doubt  on  the  individual's  current  reliability, \\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \\n \\n(b) the individual responded favorably to counseling or remedial security \\ntraining and now demonstrates a positive attitude toward the discharge of \\nsecurity responsibilities; and \\n \\n(c) the security violations were due to improper or inadequate training. \\n  \\nAG ¶¶ 35(a) through 35(c) apply. As indicated in the previous section, AG ¶ 35(a) \\nis  established.  The  particular  simulation  program  involving  inadvertent  transfers  of \\nclassified data to unclassified systems was changed to a completely classified system. \\nSuch  erroneous  “trusted  downloads”  will  not  recur.  Applicant  understands  how \\nimportant it is to avoid future transfers of classified information to unclassified computer \\nsystems.  He  has  been  counseled  and  understands  that  when  a  security  violation  is \\ndiscovered, it should be timely reported to his FSO. He has a positive attitude towards \\nconscientiously complying with security requirements.  \\n\\n \\nApplicant’s  actions  since  March  2008  show  sufficient  effort,  good  judgment, \\n  \\ntrustworthiness,  and  reliability  to  warrant  mitigation  of  handling  protected  information \\nsecurity  concerns.  Even  if  handling  protected  information  concerns  are  not  mitigated \\nunder Guideline K, they are mitigated under the whole-person concept, infra.    \\n\\n \\n\\nWhole-Person Concept \\n\\n \\n Under  the  whole-person  concept,  the  administrative  judge  must  evaluate  an \\nApplicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s \\nconduct  and all  the  circumstances. The  administrative  judge  should  consider  the nine \\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  \\n\\nthe  conduct, \\n\\nthe  nature,  extent,  and  seriousness  of \\nto \\n\\nthe  conduct;  (2) \\nthe \\n(1) \\ncircumstances  surrounding \\ninclude  knowledgeable \\nparticipation;  (3)  the  frequency  and  recency  of  the  conduct;  (4)  the \\nindividual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \\nwhich  participation \\nthe  presence  or  absence  of \\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \\nfor  the  conduct;  (8)  the  potential  for  pressure,  coercion,  exploitation,  or \\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \\n\\nis  voluntary;  (6) \\n\\n \\n13 \\n                                         \\n \\n\\n\f",
       "Under  AG  ¶  2(c),  the  ultimate  determination  of  whether  to  grant  eligibility  for  a \\nsecurity  clearance  must  be  an  overall  commonsense  judgment  based  upon  careful \\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \\ncomments under Guidelines E and K in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors \\nin AG ¶ 2(a)  were addressed under Guidelines  E and K, but some warrant additional \\ncomment. \\n\\n  \\nApplicant is a 56-year-old software engineer employed by Company D from 1980 \\nto 2007. From 2008 to present, he has been employed by another defense contractor. \\nHis spouse is a security clearance holder; his father was a career Navy officer; his two \\nolder brothers served in the Navy; and his nephew was a Navy Seal, who served three \\ntours  in  Afghanistan.  In  1982,  Applicant  received  a  bachelor  of  science  degree  in \\nmathematics.  During  Desert  Shield,  Applicant  was  deployed  for  six  months  to  the \\nPersian Gulf aboard a U.S. Navy vessel.   \\n\\n \\nA Navy captain, who has known Applicant since the late 1990s; a high-level DOD \\nemployee, who has oversight authority over about 9,000 of DOD employees and a $300 \\nmillion budget and who has known Applicant since the 1990s; a program director on a \\nproject,  who  has  known  Applicant  since  2003;  two  contractors,  who  worked  with \\nApplicant  on  the  project  at  issue;  and  Applicant’s  attorney  described  Applicant  in \\nlaudatory  terms.  Applicant  is  an  “incredibly  gifted,”  exceptionally  creative,  and \\n“incredibly skilled” technician and engineer. He is diligent, intelligent, professional, open, \\ncandid, honest, and conscientious about the protection of classified information. Most of \\nhis  character  witnesses  were  aware  of  the  SOR  allegations,  had  read  Applicant’s \\nstatements in 2011 and 2013, and recommended reinstatement of Applicant’s security \\nclearance.  \\n\\n \\nApplicant’s  SOR  allegations  relate  to  his  handling  of  confidential  information  in \\nDecember  2007  and  January  2008  and  participation  in  the  follow-up  investigation  in \\n2009  and  2010.  Company  L  or  Navy  employees  provided  “trusted  downloads”  to \\nApplicant and his team. The trusted downloads were not supposed to contain classified \\ndata or software; however, there was some classified data mixed in with the unclassified \\ndata. Applicant and other members of his team unknowingly downloaded the classified \\nand  unclassified  information  onto  computers  allocated  to  unclassified  information. \\nApplicant  did  not  compromise  classified  information  as  there  is  no  evidence  the \\nunclassified  computers  were  used  by  anyone  not  authorized  to  review  the  classified \\ninformation. In December 2007, Applicant discovered possible classified information on \\nhis unclassified computer and on B’s computer. B and Applicant agreed that they should \\ndelete  it,  and  they  did  so.  This  error  was  aggravated  when  Applicant  and  B  failed  to \\ndisclose the discovery of the probable classified information on the flash drive and their \\ncomputers  to  their  FSOs.  Applicant  did  not  receive  adequate  training  or  supervision \\nfrom  B,  a  GS-13  Navy  employee  on  this  occasion.  There  was  no  evidence  that \\nApplicant was told prior to December 2007 of the protocol after discovery of possible \\nclassified information on an unclassified computer.  \\n\\n \\nAfter  two  of  Applicant’s  assigned  DOD-issued  computers  were  requested,  he \\ndeleted Company D proprietary information and personal information before providing \\n\\n \\n14 \\n                                         \\n \\n\\n\f",
       "one  computer  to  Company  D  and  one  computer to  NCIS. These deletions  raised  the \\npossibility  that  he  was  intentionally  obstructing  the  investigation  because  forensic \\nexamination revealed there were deletions, but could not determine the content of the \\ndeletions.  Applicant  provided  the  only  evidence  of  the  content  of  the  deletions.  In \\nFebruary  2008,  after  Applicant  made  the  deletions,  he  hired  an  experienced  national \\nsecurity attorney who advised him to cooperate with the investigation. After March 2008, \\nApplicant  cooperated  with  the  investigation,  and  his  attorney  notified  the  FBI  that  he \\nwould assist the investigation. His errors in judgment were made from December 2007 \\nthrough February 2008 and are not recent.   \\n\\n \\nApplicant’s hearing statement was credible. He understands what he needs to do \\nto maintain his eligibility for access to classified information. He has avoided any hint of \\nviolation  of  his  employer’s  rules  or  security  rules  after  March  2008.  He  expressed \\nsincere remorse for his infractions of security rules and errors in judgment in December \\n2007  and  January  2008,  and  he  emphasized  his  determination  to  conscientiously \\ncomply  with  all  security  rules  and  requirements.  I  am  confident  he  will  continue  to \\nconscientiously exercise his security responsibilities in the future. \\n\\n    \\nI  have  carefully  applied  the  law,  as  set  forth  in  Egan,  Exec.  Or.  10865,  the \\nDirective,  and  the  AGs,  to  the  facts  and  circumstances  in  the  context  of  the  whole \\nperson.

Applicant  did  not  respond  to  the  FORM.  I  was \\nassigned the case on December 1, 2015. Based on a thorough review of the case file, I \\nfind that Applicant failed to carry his burden in mitigating security concerns arising under \\nboth Guideline B and Guideline E.  \\n\\n     Findings of Fact \\n\\n \\nApplicant  is  a  71-year-old  man  who  is  presently  not  working  while  his  security \\nclearance is updated. He has earned a high school diploma. He was divorced in 1998 \\n                                                           \\n1 The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \\nSecurity  Clearance  Review  Program  (January  2,  1992),  as  amended  (Directive);  and  the  adjudicative \\nguidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on September 1, 2006. \\n\\n1 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\f",
       "and is now estranged from a subsequent spouse. Facts about this estranged female are \\nunclear,  although  it  appears  she  is  from  Russia,  where  she  currently  resides  with  or \\nnear  family.  He  provided  incomplete  information  on  his  security  clearance  application \\n(SCA)  about  his  family  and  children.  Other  discrepancies  appear  throughout  his \\ninvestigatory record. Applicant presently lives in another country with a female foreign \\nnational  in  order  to  reduce  the  costs  he  would  otherwise  expend  living  in  the  United \\nStates while awaiting a return to work.  \\n \\n \\nAt issue in the SOR are the following facts: Applicant has a wife who is a citizen \\nand resident of Russia.2 They are estranged, but Applicant has no plans to divorce his \\nforeign  wife  because  he  no  longer  believes  in  divorce.  He  has  a  daughter  who  is  a \\ncitizen  of  the  United  States  and  is  currently  a  resident  of  Russia,  where  she  is  a \\nuniversity student. He also has parents-in-law who are citizens and residents of Russia. \\nApplicant met them in about July 1998 on a visit to their home. He again saw them on a \\nsubsequent  trip  to  Russia  with  his  wife.  He  has  had  no  other  contact  with  them  and \\ndoes not know how often his estranged wife currently has with her parents now that all \\nthree  are  in  Russia.  His  father-in-law  and  mother-in-law  are  a  teacher  and  a \\ngynecologist,  respectively.  Applicant  assumed  they  were  Communists  because  the \\nCommunists were in power when he met them. As of 2015, Russia is one of the two \\nleading state intelligence threats to United States interests, based on their capabilities, \\nintent,  and  broad  operational  scopes.3  Applicant  admits  the  Guideline  B  SOR \\nallegations, but did not address them in any manner in his SOR Response.     \\n \\n \\nIn completing SCAs in both August 3, 2009, and March 23, 2013, Applicant failed \\nto  list  multiple  names  he  has  used,  places  of  former  residence,  periods  of \\nunemployment, relatives, and foreign contacts. He told an investigator in 2010 that he \\nhad no problems while working with a particular employer, but later conceded he was \\ninvolved in a harassment suit while working there. Despite a 2010 claim to the contrary, \\nhe failed in 2007 to file an appropriate contact with foreign nationals report regarding the \\nforeign woman with whom he currently cohabitates. Applicant admits these allegations.  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\nPolicies \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nWhen  evaluating  an  applicant’s  suitability \\n\\n \\n \\nthe \\nadministrative  judge  must  consider  the  adjudicative  guidelines.  In  addition  to  brief \\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \\ndisqualifying  conditions  and  mitigating  conditions,  which  are  used  in  evaluating  an \\napplicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. \\n \\n\\nfor  a  security  clearance, \\n\\nThese  guidelines  are  not  inflexible  rules  of  law.  Instead,  recognizing  the \\ncomplexities  of  human  behavior,  these  guidelines  are  applied  in  conjunction  with  the \\n                                                           \\n2  In  some  records  within  the  FORM,  Applicant  indicated  that  his  estranged  wife  became  a  naturalized \\ncitizen in 2007 or 2008 and now resides in the United States, but the discrepancies are never resolved. \\n(See FORM, Item 6) \\n \\n3 FORM, Item 9, at 3. \\n\\n2 \\n\\n\f",
       "factors  listed  in  the  adjudicative  process.  The  administrative  judge’s  overarching \\nadjudicative  goal  is  a  fair,  impartial,  and  commonsense  decision.  According  to  AG  ¶ \\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \\nthe  “whole-person  concept.”  The  administrative  judge  must  consider  all  available, \\nreliable information about the person in making a decision. \\n\\n \\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) \\nrequires  that  “[a]ny  doubt  concerning  personnel  being  considered  for  access  to \\nclassified  information  will  be  resolved  in  favor  of  national  security.”  In  reaching  this \\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \\non the evidence contained in the record.  \\n\\n \\nUnder Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \\ncontroverted  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  Under  Directive  ¶  E3.1.15,  an  “applicant  is \\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \\nmitigate  facts  admitted  by  applicant  or  proven  by  Department  Counsel  and  has  the \\nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.”  \\n\\nthe  Government  predicated  upon \\n\\n \\nA  person  who  seeks  access  to  classified  information  enters  into  a  fiduciary \\nrelationship  with \\ntrust  and  confidence.  This \\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \\nGovernment  reposes  a  high  degree  of  trust  and  confidence  in  individuals  to  whom  it \\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \\nthe  possible  risk  the  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  safeguard \\nclassified information. Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall \\nbe “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \\nloyalty of the applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b).  \\n\\nThe security concern relating to the Guideline B is set out in AG ¶ 6: \\n\\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \\nany  foreign  interest.  Adjudication  under  this  Guideline  can  and  should \\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \\nfinancial \\nto,  such \\nconsiderations  as  whether  the  foreign  country  is  known  to  target  United \\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \\nrisk of terrorism. \\n\\nincluding,  but  not \\n\\nlocated, \\n\\ninterest \\n\\nlimited \\n\\nis \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n3 \\n\\nAnalysis \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\f",
       "Applicant remains married to the female of Russian origin at issue. Therefore, it \\ncan be assumed he maintains some level of affection for this woman, the mother of his \\nchild. It can also be assumed he maintains a bond or ties of affection for their child, who \\nis  now  studying  at  a  Russian  college.  As  for  his  in-laws,  while  their  contact  with \\nApplicant is negligible, it can be assumed his estranged partner has ties of affection with \\nher own parents. Those ties are routinely attributed to the spouse (Applicant) in these \\ncases. Given these facts, disqualifying conditions AG ¶¶ 7(a) and (b) apply:  \\n \\n\\nto  protect  sensitive \\n\\nAG ¶ 7(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \\nassociate,  friend,  or  other  person  who  is  a  citizen  of  or  resident  in  a \\nforeign  country  if  that  contact  creates  a  heightened  risk  of  foreign \\nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \\n \\nAG ¶ 7(b) connection to a foreign person, group, government, or country \\nthat  create  a  potential  conflict  of  interest  between  the  individual’s \\nobligation \\nthe \\nindividual’s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \\nthat information. \\n \\nIn  finding  disqualifying  conditions  applicable,  I  specifically  note  that  AG  ¶  7(a) \\nrequires substantial evidence of a heightened risk. The heightened risk required to raise \\na  disqualifying  condition  is  a  relatively  low  standard.  Heightened  risk  denotes  a  risk \\ngreater than the normal risk inherent in having a family member living under a foreign \\ngovernment or substantial assets in a foreign nation. Russia is one of the two leading \\nstate intelligence threats to United States interests. In addition, foreign family ties can \\npose a security risk even without a connection to a foreign government. This is because \\nan applicant may be subject to coercion or undue influence when a third party pressures \\nor  threatens  an  applicant’s family  members.  Under  these facts,  while  unlikely,  a  third \\nparty  coercion  concern  potentially  exists  in  Russia.  Therefore,  there  is  sufficient \\nevidence to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \\n\\ninformation  or \\n\\ntechnology  and \\n\\n  \\nAG ¶ 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \\n\\nof the mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 8, and find the following are relevant: \\n \\n\\nAG ¶ 8(a) the nature of the relationship with foreign persons, the country in \\nwhich  these  persons  are  located,  or  the  positions  or  activities  of  those \\npersons  in  that  country  are  such  that  it  is  unlikely  the  individual  will  be \\nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \\nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.; \\nand \\n\\n \\n\\nAG  ¶  8(b)  there  is  no  conflict  of  interest,  either  because  the  individual’s \\nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or \\ncountry  is  so  minimal,  or  the  individual  has  such  deep  and  longstanding \\nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to \\nresolve any conflict of interests in favor of the U.S. interests.  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n4 \\n\\n\f",
       "The mere possession of close family ties to persons in a foreign country is not, \\nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in \\na foreign country and an applicant has frequent, non-casual contacts with that relative, \\nthis  factor  alone  is  sufficient  to  create  the  potential  for  foreign  influence  and  could \\npotentially result in the compromise of classified information.  \\n\\n \\nHere,  Applicant  provided  scant  information about  his estranged  wife,  daughter, \\nand  in-laws.  Indeed,  information  about  his  in-laws  is  more  abundant  than  information \\nabout his child and her mother. While his personal ties to his in-laws may be weak, their \\nimpact on Applicant cannot be discerned without more information about his wife and \\nchild. Under these limited facts, no mitigating conditions weigh in Applicant’s favor. \\n\\nThe  security  concern  for  personal  conduct  is  set  out  in  AG  ¶  15,  where  the \\nsignificance of conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \\nunwillingness  to  comply  with  rules  and  regulations  is  defined  ([p]ersonal  conduct  can \\nraise  questions  about  an  individual’s  reliability,  trustworthiness  and  ability  to  protect \\nclassified  information).  Of  special  interest  is  any  failure to  provide  truthful and  candid \\nanswers during the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the \\nsecurity clearance process.  \\n\\n \\nIn completing his 2009 and 2013 SCAs, Applicant’s answers in many areas were \\neither deficient or in conflict. His answers in a 2010 interview were either intentionally or \\nnegligently incomplete  with regard to past  workplace problems and the reporting of a \\nforeign  cohabitant  to  his  former  employer.  If  these  inaccuracies  were  intentionally \\nincorrect, such facts could give rise to:  \\n\\n \\nAG  ¶  16(a)  deliberate  omission,  concealment,  or  falsification  of  relevant \\nfacts \\nfrom  any  personnel  security  questionnaire,  personal  history \\nstatement,  or  similar  form  used  to  conduct  investigations,  determine \\nemployment  qualifications,  award  benefits  or  status,  determine  security \\nclearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities, \\nand  \\n \\nAG  ¶  16(b)  deliberately  providing \\ninformation \\nconcerning  relevant  facts  to  an  employer,  investigator,  security  official, \\ncompetent medical authority, or other official government representative. \\n \\nApplicant admitted all three allegations raised under Guideline E and provided no \\nexplanations or commentary. While his admission to the SCA discrepancies could be \\ndiscounted and his discrepancies found to be the product of negligence, this guideline \\ncould  be  found  in  his  favor.  In  admitting  allegations  that  he  knowingly  withheld \\ninformation and denied having had problems while employed at a place where he was \\ninvolved in a harassment suit, however, the facts tend to indicate that these answers – \\nwithout  more  –  were  intentionally  false  or  misleading.  This  is  particularly  true  in  the \\n5 \\n\\nfalse  or  misleading \\n\\n \\n\\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n\f",
       "absence  of  some  explanation  claiming  forgetfulness  or  another  basis  for  having \\nprovided a negligently entered SCA answer. Therefore, given his admissions, none of \\nthe mitigating conditions at AG ¶ 17(a) – (g) apply.  \\n\\nWhole-Person Concept \\n \\n \\nUnder  the  whole-person  concept,  the  administrative  judge  must  evaluate  an \\napplicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s \\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a). Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) \\nwere addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment.  \\n \\n \\nApplicant failed to do more than admit the allegations raised in the SOR. He then \\nrequested a judgment based on the written record. It is that very record that is full of \\ndiscrepancies  and  contradictions  that  contributed  to  the  security  concerns  at  issue. \\nThere  are  simply  insufficient  facts  to  evaluate  Applicant’s  foreign  kin,  the  SCA  and \\ninterview inaccuracies, or even the Applicant as an individual. This is simply the result of \\na  deficiently  supplemented  record.  Without  more,  there  is  insufficient  information  to \\nrebut, refute, or mitigate the security concerns raised under the foreign influence and \\npersonal conduct guidelines.   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nFOREIGN INFLUENCE  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nAllegations 1.a-1.c:   \\n\\nPERSONAL CONDUCT \\n  \\n \\n\\nAllegations 2.a-2.c:   \\n\\n \\n\\nFormal Findings \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nAGAINST APPLICANT \\n\\nAgainst Applicant \\n\\nAGAINST APPLICANT \\n\\nAgainst Applicant  \\n\\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n     Conclusion \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \\nclearly  consistent  with  the  national  interest  to  grant  Applicant  a  security  clearance. \\nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n                                             \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n_____________________________ \\n\\n \\n\\nArthur E.

The FORM was mailed to Applicant, who \\nreceived it on October 19, 2015. Applicant was given an opportunity to file objections \\nand submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. He submitted an undated \\nresponse to the FORM, which was admitted without objection as Applicant Exhibit (AE) \\nA. The case was assigned to me on December 21, 2015.  \\n\\nIn Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted all but one of the allegations. The \\nadmissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a careful review of the pleadings and \\nevidence, I make the following additional findings of fact.1 \\n\\n \\nApplicant is 56 years old. He has worked for a defense contractor since 1997. He \\nis divorced and has three children, ages 15, 18, and 20. He has a bachelor’s degree. He \\nhas no military experience.2  \\n \\n \\n \\nApplicant’s conduct raised in the SOR included: a history of consuming alcohol, \\nat times, to excess from 1974 to about April 2014; being found guilty for operating under \\nthe  influence  of  alcohol  (OUI)  in  February  1991;  being  found  guilty  for  OUI  2nd  in \\nNovember 1997; and being found guilty for OUI 3rd in November 2010 (See SOR ¶¶ 1.a \\n- 1.d).3 \\n \\n \\nApplicant  began  drinking  alcohol  when  he  was  approximately  15  years  old  in \\n1974. He drinks beer on most occasions. Even after his OUI convictions, he stated he \\nwas  still  was  consuming  two  to  three  beers  a  week.  He  drinks  in  social  settings  and \\nafter hockey games. As a result of his 2010 OUI conviction, he lost his driver’s license \\nfor five years. He completed his probation in May 2015.4 \\n \\n \\nCourt documents establish that Applicant was found guilty of three OUI offenses, \\nin 1992 (1991 arrest), 2000 (1997 arrest), and 2012 (2010 arrest). He was placed on \\nprobation in each instance.5 \\n \\n \\nIn  February  1991,  Applicant  was  driving  home  from  a  friend’s  house  where  he \\nconsumed  about  four  beers.  He  was  stopped  by  a  police  officer  who  had  observed \\nApplicant’s  car  cross  over  the  center  line.  Applicant  was  given,  and  failed,  a  field \\nsobriety test. He was taken into the police station where he refused a breathalyzer test. \\n                                                           \\n1 Item 2. \\n \\n2 Item 4. \\n \\n3 Items 1, 3. \\n \\n4 Item 10; AE A. \\n \\n5 Item 7, 9; AE A. \\n \\n\\n \\n\\nFindings of Fact \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n2 \\n \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "He was charged with OUI and later pleaded guilty. He was required to attend 12 weeks \\nof alcohol education and counseling classes, which he completed.6 \\n \\n \\nIn November 1997, Applicant was going home from a high school football game \\nwhen he was stopped in traffic by a police officer. Applicant had two beers before the \\ngame  and  shared  a  flask  containing  some  kind  of  alcohol  at  the  game.  The  officer \\napparently  asked  Applicant \\nif  he  had  been  drinking  and  Applicant  answered \\naffirmatively. He was then given field sobriety tests, which he failed. He was arrested, \\ntaken back to the police station and given a breathalyzer test, which he also failed. He \\nwas  found  guilty  of  OUI  and  sentenced  to  two  years’  probation,  loss  of  his  driver’s \\nlicense  for  six  months,  and  12  weeks  required  attendance  at  alcohol  education  and \\ncounseling classes.7 \\n \\n \\nIn  November  2010,  Applicant  was  driving  back  from  a  hockey  tournament  and \\nwas stopped by a state patrolman because he crossed the center line. Applicant had \\nconsumed six beers and shared a flask of whiskey at the hockey tournament. He failed \\nthe  field  sobriety  tests  and  was  almost  incoherent  to  the  patrolman.  He  was  arrested \\nand taken to a police station where he was offered a breathalyzer test. He was unable \\nto properly perform the test, which was deemed a refusal to take the test. He was found \\nguilty of OUI and sentenced to six months’ incarceration, five years of probation, loss of \\ndriver’s  license  for  five  years,  and  mandatory  substance  abuse  evaluation  and \\ntreatment.8 \\n \\nThe court-ordered substance abuse treatment involved two mandatory sessions \\n \\nand  Applicant  voluntarily  attended  six  more  sessions.  He \\nto  provide \\ndocumentation of any evaluation done by the counselors, but Applicant stated he was \\ndiagnosed  as  being  an  alcohol  abuser.  Applicant  also  attended  Alcohol  Anonymous \\n(AA) meetings once every six to eight weeks. He last attended an AA meeting in May \\n2015. He continued to drink an occasional beer every few months. In May 2015, at an \\nAA meeting he heard a story had made him decide to stop drinking alcohol entirely. He \\nclaims he has not had any alcohol since that time.9 \\n \\n\\nfailed \\n\\nfor  a  security  clearance, \\n\\nWhen  evaluating  an  applicant’s  suitability \\n\\n \\nthe \\nadministrative  judge  must  consider  the  adjudicative  guidelines.  In  addition  to  brief \\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \\ndisqualifying  conditions  and  mitigating  conditions,  which  are  used  in  evaluating  an \\napplicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. \\n                                                           \\n6 Item 10. \\n \\n7 Item 10. \\n \\n8 Items 7, 10. \\n \\n9 Item 6-10; AE A. \\n \\n\\nPolicies \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n3 \\n \\n \\n\\n\n",

Instead,  recognizing  the \\ncomplexities  of  human  behavior,  these  guidelines  are  applied  in  conjunction  with  the \\nfactors  listed  in  the  adjudicative  process.  The  administrative  judge’s  overarching \\nadjudicative  goal  is  a  fair,  impartial,  and  commonsense  decision.  According  to  AG  ¶ \\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \\nthe  “whole-person  concept.”  The  administrative  judge  must  consider  all  available, \\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \\nmaking a decision. \\n\\n \\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) \\nrequires  that  “[a]ny  doubt  concerning  personnel  being  considered  for  access  to \\nclassified  information  will  be  resolved  in  favor  of  national  security.”  In  reaching  this \\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \\non the evidence contained in the record.  \\n\\n \\nUnder Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \\ncontroverted  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  Under  Directive  ¶  E3.1.15,  an  “applicant  is \\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \\nmitigate  facts  admitted  by  applicant  or  proven  by  Department  Counsel,  and  has  the \\nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.”  \\n\\nthe  Government  predicated  upon \\n\\n \\nA  person  who  seeks  access  to  classified  information  enters  into  a  fiduciary \\nrelationship  with \\ntrust  and  confidence.  This \\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \\nGovernment  reposes  a  high  degree  of  trust  and  confidence  in  individuals  to  whom  it \\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \\nthe  possible  risk  that  an  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  safeguard \\nclassified  information.  Such  decisions  entail  a  certain  degree  of  legally  permissible \\nextrapolation  about  potential,  rather  than  actual,  risk  of  compromise  of  classified \\ninformation. \\n\\n \\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of \\nthe national interest and shall  in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \\napplicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \\n\\nAnalysis \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \\n\\nAG ¶ 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption: \\n\\nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \\njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \\nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \\n\\n \\n4 \\n \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "AG  ¶  22  describes  conditions  that  could  raise  a  security  concern  and  may  be \\n\\ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \\n\\n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \\nthe  influence,  fighting,  child  or  spouse  abuse,  disturbing  the  peace,  or \\nother  incidents  of  concern,  regardless  of  whether  the  individual  is \\ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent;  \\n\\n(c)  habitual  or  binge  consumption  of  alcohol  to  the  point  of  impaired \\njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol \\nabuser or alcohol dependent. \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\nof both disqualifying conditions.  \\n\\nApplicant’s three OUI convictions and his drinking history support the application \\n\\nI  have  also  considered  all  of  the  mitigating  conditions  for  alcohol  consumption \\n\\nunder AG ¶ 23 and found the following relevant: \\n\\n(a)  so  much  time  has  passed,  or  the  behavior  was  so  infrequent,  or  it \\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \\nor good judgment; and \\n\\n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol \\nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \\nhas  established  a  pattern  of  abstinence  (if  alcohol  dependent)  or \\nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser). \\n\\n \\nApplicant’s  last  adverse  alcohol  incident  occurred  in  November  2010  and  he \\ncame  off  probation  for  that  offense  in  May  2015.  His  three  OUI  convictions  are  not \\ninfrequent  under  these  circumstances.  Insufficient  attenuation  exists  to  conclude \\nenough  time  has  passed  since  his  last  alcohol-related  incident.  His  history  of  OUI \\narrests  and  convictions  under  similar  circumstances  suggest  that  recurrence  is  a \\npossibility. His current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment are in doubt. AG ¶ \\n23(a) does not apply. \\n \\nApplicant recently decided to totally abstain from using alcohol. He indicated that \\n \\nhe has abstained since May 2015. While this is a commendable start, it is too soon to \\ndetermine whether his abstinence will continue to be part of his life or whether he will \\nuse alcohol responsibly in the future. AG ¶ 23(b) partially applies.   \\n \\nWhole-Person Concept \\n \\nUnder  the  whole-person  concept,  the  administrative  judge  must  evaluate  an \\n \\napplicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s \\n\\n \\n5 \\n \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  \\n \\n\\nthe  conduct, \\n\\nthe  nature,  extent,  and  seriousness  of \\nto \\n\\n(1) \\nthe  conduct;  (2) \\nthe \\ncircumstances  surrounding \\ninclude  knowledgeable \\nparticipation;  (3)  the  frequency  and  recency  of  the  conduct;  (4)  the \\nindividual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \\nwhich  participation \\nthe  presence  or  absence  of \\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \\nfor  the  conduct;  (8)  the  potential  for  pressure,  coercion,  exploitation,  or \\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \\n \\n\\nis  voluntary;  (6) \\n\\nUnder AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \\nof the guideline and the whole-person concept.        \\n\\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered the circumstances that \\nled  to  his  arrests  and  his  current  state  of  abstinence.  Overall,  the  record  evidence \\nleaves  me  with  questions  and  doubts  as  to  Applicant’s  eligibility  and  suitability  for  a \\nsecurity  clearance.  For  all  these  reasons,  I  conclude  Applicant  failed  to  mitigate  the \\nsecurity concerns under Guideline G. \\n\\nFormal Findings \\n\\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \\n\\n \\n \\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \\n \\n \\n \\n\\nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.d: \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nAgainst Applicant \\n\\nAGAINST APPLICANT \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nConclusion \\n\\n \\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \\nclearly  consistent  with  the  national  interest  to  grant  Applicant  eligibility  for  a  security \\nclearance.

Zaid, Esq. \\n\\nLOUGHRAN, Edward W., Administrative Judge: \\n\\n \\nApplicant  mitigated  the  financial  considerations  security  concerns.  Eligibility  for \\n\\naccess to classified information is granted.  \\n \\n\\nStatement of the Case \\n\\nOn October 28, 2014, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \\nReasons  (SOR)  to  Applicant  detailing  security  concerns  under  Guideline  F,  financial \\nconsiderations. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \\n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \\n1992),  as  amended  (Directive);  and  the  adjudicative  guidelines  (AG)  implemented  by \\nthe DOD on September 1, 2006. \\n\\n \\nApplicant  responded  to  the  SOR  on  November  14,  2014,  and  requested  a \\nhearing  before  an  administrative  judge.  The  case  was  originally  assigned  to  me  on \\nFebruary 27, 2015. Scheduling of the case was delayed because Applicant was working \\noverseas. The case was reassigned to me on May 4, 2015. After coordinating with the \\nparties, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n1 \\n\\n\n",
       "on  July  16,  2015,  scheduling  the  hearing  for  August  18,  2015.  The  hearing  was \\nconvened  as  scheduled.  DOHA  received  the  hearing  transcript  (Tr.)  on  August  26, \\n2015.  \\n \\n\\nEvidentiary Rulings \\n\\nGovernment  Exhibits  (GE)  1,  2,  4,  5,  and  6  were  admitted  in  evidence  without \\nobjection. GE 3 was admitted over Applicant’s objection. Applicant testified, called five \\nwitnesses, and submitted Applicant’s Exhibits (AE) A through Z, which were admitted \\nwithout  objection.  The  record  was  held  open  for  Applicant  to  submit  additional \\ninformation. He submitted documents that I have marked AE AA and BB1 and admitted \\nwithout objection.  \\n \\n\\nFindings of Fact \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\nApplicant is a 57-year-old self-employed contractor for a defense contractor. He \\nserved  in  the  U.S.  military  from  1979  until  he  retired  in  2000.  He  seeks  to  retain  a \\nsecurity clearance, which he has held since he was in the military. He attended college \\nfor a period, but he is a few credits shy of a degree. His first marriage ended in divorce. \\nHe has been married to his current spouse for more than 25 years. He has two adult \\nchildren.2 \\n \\n \\nApplicant spent the majority of his military career in special operations. He went \\non  numerous  combat  missions,  conducted  clandestine  insertions,  and  operated \\nundercover.  When  he  retired  he  became  an  entrepreneur  and  started  his  own \\ncompanies.  His  primary  company  was  incorporated,  but  Applicant  had  to  personally \\nguarantee many of the company’s liabilities. He also invested in real estate.

The \\nowner of the warehouse sued  Applicant  personally  and  obtained a $58,161 judgment \\nagainst  him  (SOR  ¶  1.a).

In  July  2015,  the  IRS \\naccepted  Applicant’s  installment  agreement  and  added  his  2014  taxes.  On  June  5, \\n2015,  Applicant  paid  the  IRS  $56,415  for  his  2014  taxes.  On  July  9,  2015,  he  paid \\n$10,000 toward his estimated taxes for 2015.8 \\n \\n \\nApplicant used to own five properties consisting of his residence and four rental \\nproperties.

He credibly testified that it will \\ntake time, but he is committed to resolving all his debts.14  \\n \\n \\nApplicant’s character evidence was extraordinary.

In  addition  to  brief \\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \\ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \\napplicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. \\n \\n\\nfor  a  security  clearance, \\n\\nThese  guidelines  are  not  inflexible  rules  of  law.  Instead,  recognizing  the \\ncomplexities  of  human  behavior,  administrative  judges  apply  the  guidelines  in \\nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s \\noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \\nto  AG  ¶  2(c),  the  entire  process  is  a  conscientious  scrutiny  of  a  number  of  variables \\nknown  as  the  “whole-person  concept.”  The  administrative  judge  must  consider  all \\navailable,  reliable  information  about  the  person,  past  and  present,  favorable  and \\nunfavorable, in making a decision. \\n\\n \\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) \\nrequires  that  “[a]ny  doubt  concerning  personnel  being  considered  for  access  to \\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.”  \\n\\n \\nUnder Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \\ncontroverted  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  Under  Directive  ¶  E3.1.15,  the  applicant  is \\nresponsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \\nor  mitigate  facts  admitted  by  the  applicant  or  proven  by  Department  Counsel.”  The \\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \\n\\nthe  Government  predicated  upon \\n\\n \\nA  person  who  seeks  access  to  classified  information  enters  into  a  fiduciary \\n \\nrelationship  with \\ntrust  and  confidence.  This \\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \\nGovernment  reposes  a  high  degree  of  trust  and  confidence  in  individuals  to  whom  it \\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \\nthe  possible  risk  the  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  safeguard \\nclassified  information.  Such  decisions  entail  a  certain  degree  of  legally  permissible \\n                                                           \\n14 Tr. at 50, 180-181, 190-193, 197; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 3 ; AE A, U, W, Y. \\n \\n15 Tr. at 25-28, 50-51, 62-74; AE B-L, T. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n5 \\n\\n\n",

An \\n\\nindividual  who \\n\\nis \\n\\n(a)  the  behavior  happened  so  long  ago,  was  so  infrequent,  or  occurred \\nunder  such  circumstances  that  it  is  unlikely  to  recur  and  does  not  cast \\ndoubt  on  the  individual’s  current  reliability,  trustworthiness,  or  good \\njudgment; \\n\\n(b)  the  conditions  that  resulted  in  the  financial  problem  were  largely \\nbeyond  the  person’s  control  (e.g.,  loss  of  employment,  a  business \\ndownturn,  unexpected  medical  emergency,  or  a  death,  divorce  or \\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \\n\\n \\n6 \\n\\nAG ¶ 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \\n\\n \\n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \\n\\n \\n\\n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\nevidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions.  \\n \\n  \\nprovided under AG ¶ 20.

Additionally, the SOR alleged the high credit on the two \\nmortgage  loans  (SOR  ¶¶  1.d  -  $351,562  and  1.e  -  $271,900),  when  the  balances  on \\nthose loans were reported as zero.  \\n \\n  \\nApplicant paid his 2008 federal income taxes. He has a payment plan in place for \\nhis  2012  and  2013  tax  years.  He  settled  and  paid  the  second  mortgage  loan  on  his \\nhome,  and  he  paid  other  debts  that  were  not  alleged  in  the  SOR.  His  attorney  is \\nnegotiating  settlements  for  the  two  judgments  against  him.  Applicant  credibly  testified \\nthat it will take time, but he is committed to resolving all his debts. \\n \\n \\nI find that Applicant established a plan to resolve his financial problems, and he \\ntook significant action to implement that plan. He acted responsibly and made a good-\\nfaith effort to pay his debts. There are clear indications that his financial problems are \\nbeing  resolved  and  are  under  control.  They  occurred  under  circumstances  that  are \\nunlikely  to  recur  and  do  not  cast  doubt  on  his  current  reliability,  trustworthiness,  and \\ngood judgment. AG ¶¶ 20(c) and 20(d) are applicable. AG ¶ 20(b) is partially applicable. \\nAG ¶ 20(a) is not yet completely applicable because Applicant is still in the process of \\npaying his debts.  \\n \\nWhole-Person Concept \\n \\nUnder  the  whole-person  concept,  the  administrative  judge  must  evaluate  an \\n \\napplicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s \\nconduct  and  all  relevant  circumstances.  The  administrative  judge  should  consider  the \\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nthe  conduct, \\n\\nthe  nature,  extent,  and  seriousness  of \\nto \\n\\nthe  conduct;  (2) \\nthe \\n(1) \\ncircumstances  surrounding \\ninclude  knowledgeable \\nparticipation;  (3)  the  frequency  and  recency  of  the  conduct;  (4)  the \\nindividual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \\nwhich  participation \\nthe  presence  or  absence  of \\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \\nfor  the  conduct;  (8)  the  potential  for  pressure,  coercion,  exploitation,  or \\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \\n\\nis  voluntary;  (6) \\n\\n \\n7 \\n\\n\n",
       " \\nUnder AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \\nsecurity  clearance  must  be  an  overall  commonsense  judgment  based  upon  careful \\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \\n \\n\\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions  in  light  of  all \\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.

Applicant had no objection to the motion.

Applicant had no \\nobjection to the amendment. The motion to amend was granted.2 \\n \\n\\nFindings of Fact \\n\\n \\n \\nApplicant is a 40-year-old mechanic who works as a quality assurance inspector \\nfor  a  defense  contractor.  He  has  been  working  for  that  contractor  in  the  Middle  East \\nsince May 2011 and has worked overseas for other defense contractors for a number of \\nyears.  He  earned  a  general  educational  development  certificate  in  1996  and  an \\nassociate’s degree in 2003. He has been married twice. He married his current wife in \\n2005. He has three children, ages 15, 16, and 22.3 \\n \\n\\nExcluding  the  withdrawn  allegations,  the  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  had  three \\ndelinquent  debts  totaling  $64,168  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.c).  In  his  Answer  to  the  SOR,  he \\ndenied each debt. Substantial evidence of the alleged debts is contained in GE 1-4.4  \\n\\n \\nIn 1999, Applicant was involved in a car accident and incurred a broken pelvis \\nand hip. He was determined to be fully disabled and collected about $1,000 per month \\nin disability payments from the Social Security Administration (SSA). While receiving the \\ndisability benefits, he knew there was a limit on how much income he could earn, but \\ndid not know the exact restrictions. In 2006, he received a letter from SSA that indicated \\n                                                           \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n1 Tr. 23-25.  \\n\\n2 Tr. 43-44.  \\n\\n3 Tr. 5-7, 23, 37-39, 42-43; GE 1. \\n\\n4 GE 1-4; Applicant’s Answer to the SOR.  \\n\\n \\n2 \\n \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "he was earning more income than he was allowed. At that time, his disability payments \\nstopped, and he has not received any further disability payments since then.5 \\n\\n \\nA credit report dated June 12, 2010, reflected that Applicant’s SSA account had \\nbeen  placed  for  collection  in  the  amount  of  $20,955  (SOR  ¶  1.c).  This  delinquent \\naccount was the result of his overpayment of disability payments. In 2008, he started \\nrepaying this debt through a monthly pay allotment of $300. When he left his job later \\nthat year, the allotment stopped. In 2012, the SSA began garnishing his pay at a rate of \\n$600 every two weeks. By early 2014 (well before the issuance of the SOR), he fully \\nrepaid this debt. In July 2014, he received a letter from the SSA stating he overpaid the \\ndebt and would be receiving a refund of $2,535.6 \\n\\n \\nIn 2008 and 2009, Applicant worked overseas, and a portion of his income was \\nexempt from taxation. In those years, his income was greater than the exemption, and \\nhe incurred taxes that he could not pay. In his security clearance application (SCA), he \\ndisclosed that he owed approximately $36,000 to the IRS for 2008 and 2009 (SOR ¶ \\n1.b). In 2010, his state also filed a $7,213 tax lien against him (SOR ¶ 1.a).7 \\n\\n \\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant stated that the state tax lien had been repaid \\nthrough monthly payroll deductions. He also stated that he had a repayment plan with \\nthe IRS and the payments are automatically deducted from his pay.8  \\n\\n  \\nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that the state tax lien was repaid, but he had \\nnot  yet  received  a  document  from  the  state  showing  it  was  paid.  He  stated  that  the \\ndeductions from his pay for the state tax lien stopped over a year ago. At the hearing, \\nhe also provided IRS account transcripts for 2008 and 2009 that showed he had been \\nconsistently  making  monthly  payments  of  $375  since  August  2012.  As  of  September \\n2015,  his  IRS  account  balance  for  2008  was  $3,961  and  for  2009  was  $17,124.  The \\naccount transcripts showed that his IRS debt had been cut almost in half.9 \\n\\n  \\nBesides the debts alleged in the SOR, Applicant’s credit report dated March 26, \\n2015, reflected that he had no other delinquent debts. He also testified that he had no \\nother delinquent debts. In 2014, he earned about $108,000 and his wife earned about \\n$25,000. In his post-hearing submission, Applicant presented letters from the state that \\nreflected he did not have an outstanding tax liability for 2008 and 2009.10 \\n\\n                                                           \\n\\n5 Tr. 26-29; GE 1. \\n \\n6 Tr. 29-32; GE 1-3; AE C. \\n \\n7 Tr. 32-36; GE 1.    \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n8 Applicant’s Answer to the SOR. \\n\\n9 Tr. 32-36, 46-51; AE D-F. \\n\\n10 Tr. 39-42; AE A, B, H, I; Applicant’s Answer to the SOR. \\n\\n \\n3 \\n \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "Policies \\n\\n \\n\\nThe  President  of  the  United  States  has  the  authority  to  control  access  to \\ninformation  bearing  on  national  security  and  to  determine  whether  an  individual  is \\nsufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. Department of the Navy v. \\nEgan,  484  U.S.  518,  527  (1988).  The  President  has  authorized  the  Secretary  of \\nDefense to grant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it \\nis clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \\nClassified  Information  within  Industry  §  2  (Feb.  20,  1960),  as  amended.  The  U.S. \\nSupreme  Court  has  recognized  the  substantial  discretion  of  the  Executive  Branch  in \\nregulating  access  to  information  pertaining  to  national  security,  emphasizing  that  “no \\none  has  a  ‘right’  to  a  security  clearance.”  Department  of  the  Navy  v.  Egan,  484  U.S. \\n518, 528 (1988). \\n\\n \\nEligibility  for  a  security  clearance  is  predicated  upon  the  applicant  meeting  the \\ncriteria  contained  in  the  adjudicative  guidelines.  These  AGs  are  not  inflexible  rules  of \\nlaw.  Instead,  recognizing  the  complexities  of  human  behavior,  these  guidelines  are \\napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s \\nadjudicative  goal  is  a  fair,  impartial,  and  commonsense  decision.  An  administrative \\njudge  must  consider  all  available,  reliable  information  about  the  person,  past  and \\npresent, favorable and unfavorable, in reaching a decision.  \\n\\n \\nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \\naccess  to  classified  information.  This  relationship  transcends  normal  duty  hours  and \\nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \\npossible  risk  that  the  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  safeguard \\nclassified  information.  Such  decisions  entail  a  certain  degree  of  legally  permissible \\nextrapolation  of  potential,  rather  than  actual,  risk  of  compromise  of  classified \\ninformation. Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in \\nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. \\nOr.  10865  §  7.  See  also  Executive  Order  12968  (Aug.  2,  1995),  Section  3.  Thus,  a \\nclearance  decision  is  merely  an  indication  that  the  Applicant  has  or  has  not  met  the \\nstrict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing \\na clearance. \\n\\n \\nInitially,  the  Government  must  establish,  by  substantial  evidence,  conditions  in \\nthe  personal  or  professional  history  of  the  applicant  that  may  disqualify  the  applicant \\nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \\nof  establishing  controverted  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  See  Egan,  484  U.S.  at  531.  \\n“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. \\nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \\npresume  a  nexus  or  rational  connection  between  proven  conduct  under  any  of  the \\ncriteria listed and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \\n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n4 \\n \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "Once  the  Government  establishes  a  disqualifying  condition  by  substantial \\nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \\nfacts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \\nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue [his or her] security \\nclearance.”  ISCR  Case  No.  01-20700  at  3  (App.  Bd.  Dec.  19,  2002).  The  burden  of \\ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. \\n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \\nif they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   \\n\\nAnalysis \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \\n\\n \\nThe security concern for this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 18 as follows: \\n\\n \\n\\nFailure  or  inability  to  live  within  one’s  means,  satisfy  debts,  and  meet \\nfinancial  obligations  may  indicate  poor  self-control,  lack  of  judgment,  or \\nunwillingness  to  abide  by  rules  and  regulations,  all  of  which  can  raise \\nquestions  about  an  individual’s  reliability,  trustworthiness  and  ability  to \\nprotect  classified \\nfinancially \\noverextended  is  at  risk  of  having  to  engage  in  illegal  acts  to  generate \\nfunds.  \\n \\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \\n\\ninformation.

Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \\n\\n \\n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and  \\n\\n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nThe  evidence  established  that  Applicant  accumulated  delinquent  debts  that  he \\nwas unable or unwilling to pay for an extended period. AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) apply in \\nthis case. \\n \\n \\napplicable:  \\n \\n\\nFour financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially \\n\\n(a)  the  behavior  happened  so  long  ago,  was  so  infrequent,  or  occurred \\nunder  such  circumstances  that  it  is  unlikely  to  recur  and  does  not  cast \\ndoubt  on  the  individual’s  current  reliability,  trustworthiness,  or  good \\njudgment; \\n \\n(b)  the  conditions  that  resulted  in  the  financial  problem  were  largely \\nbeyond  the  person’s  control  (e.g.,  loss  of  employment,  a  business \\ndownturn,  unexpected  medical  emergency,  or  a  death,  divorce  or \\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \\n\\n \\n5 \\n \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "(c)  the  person  has  received  or  is  receiving  counseling  for  the  problem \\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \\nunder control; and \\n \\n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \\notherwise resolve debts.  \\n \\nApplicant  incurred  delinquent  debts  because  he  continued  to  receive  disability \\nbenefits  after  his  income  exceeded  earning  limitations  and  because  he  failed  to  pay \\ntaxes  on  income  earned  in  2008  and  2009.  These  events  do  not  constitute \\ncircumstances beyond his control. AG ¶ 20(b) does not apply. \\n\\n \\nApplicant  has  resolved  the  state  tax  lien  in  SOR  ¶  1.a  and  the  disability \\noverpayment  in  SOR  ¶  1.c.  He  has  established  a  repayment  plan  to  resolve  the \\ndelinquent  federal  taxes  in  SOR  ¶  1.b.  He  has  been  consistently  making  payments \\nunder  that  plan  for  the  past  three  years.  The  record  established  that  his  financial \\nproblems  are  under  control  and  are  being  resolved.  He  has  not  incurred  any  recent \\ndelinquent debts. His financial problems are unlikely to recur and do not cast doubt on \\nhis current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(c), and 20(d) \\napply. \\n\\n \\n\\nWhole-Person Concept \\n\\nIn  the  adjudication  process,  an  administrative  judge  must  carefully  weigh  a \\nnumber  of  variables  known  as  the  whole-person  concept.  Available  information  about \\nthe applicant as well as the factors listed in AG ¶ 2(a) should be considered in reaching \\na  determination.11  In  this  case,  I  gave  due  consideration  to  the  information  about \\nApplicant in the record and concluded the favorable information, including the mitigating \\nevidence,  outweigh  the  security  concerns  at  issue.  Applicant  met  his  burden  of \\npersuasion to mitigate the security concerns.  \\n\\nFormal findings as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive \\n\\nare:          \\n\\nFormal Findings \\n\\n \\n\\n                                                           \\n\\n11 The adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a) are as follows:  \\n\\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the \\nconduct,  to  include  knowledgeable  participation;  (3)  the  frequency  and  recency  of  the \\nconduct;  (4)  the  individual’s  age  and  maturity  at  the  time  of  the  conduct;  (5)  the  extent  to \\nwhich  participation  is  voluntary;  (6)  the  presence  or  absence  of  rehabilitation  and  other \\npermanent  behavioral  changes;  (7)  the  motivation  for  the  conduct;  (8)  the  potential  for \\npressure,  coercion,  exploitation,  or  duress;  and  (9)  the  likelihood  of  continuation  or \\nrecurrence. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n6 \\n \\n \\n\\n\n",

All  allegations  relate  to  his  handling  of  confidential  data  in  December  2007 \\nand January 2008 and his participation in the follow-up investigation in 2009 and 2010. \\nApplicant was assured that “trusted downloads” provided by the Navy and Company L \\ndid not contain classified information, when two of them contained a mix of unclassified \\nand  classified  information.  Applicant  and  his  team  members  transferred  the  trusted \\ndownloads onto computers that were for unclassified use only. There was no evidence \\nthat any of the classified information was viewed by anyone not authorized to view it. \\nApplicant made some judgment errors in his reaction to the discovery of the classified \\ninformation. In March 2008, Applicant’s attorney offered to provide requested materials \\nto the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI); Applicant cooperated with the investigation; \\nand  Applicant’s  errors  in  judgment  are  not  recent.  He  credibly  assured  conscientious \\ncompliance with security rules. He presented a strong case of whole-person mitigation. \\nSecurity concerns are mitigated. Access to classified information is granted.      \\n  \\n\\nHistory of the Case \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nOn  February  11,  2011,  Applicant  completed  and  signed  an  Electronic \\nQuestionnaires  for  Investigations  Processing  (e-QIP)  (SF  86).  (Government  Exhibit \\n(GE)  1)  On  August  18,  2014,  the  Department  of  Defense  (DOD)  Consolidated \\nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued an SOR to Applicant pursuant to Executive Order \\n\\n \\n1 \\n                                         \\n \\n\\n\n",

(Hearing  Exhibit  (HE)  2)  Specifically,  the  SOR  set  forth  security \\nconcerns arising under Guidelines K and E.   \\n\\n  \\nOn  September  2,  2014,  Applicant  responded  to  the  SOR,  and  he  requested  a \\nhearing.  On  July  23,  2015,  Department  Counsel  was  ready  to  proceed.  On  July  30, \\n2015,  the  case  was  assigned  to  me.  On  November  12,  2015,  the  Defense  Office  of \\nHearings  and  Appeals  (DOHA)  issued  a  notice  of  hearing,  setting  the  hearing  for \\nDecember 14, 2015. (HE 1) The hearing was held as scheduled. On December 7, 2015, \\nDepartment  Counsel  moved  to  amend  the  allegation  in  SOR  ¶  1.b.  There  was  no \\nobjection,  and  I  granted  the  motion.  During  the  hearing,  Department  Counsel  offered \\nseven  exhibits,  which  were  admitted  into  evidence  without  objection,  and  Applicant \\noffered  18  exhibits,  which  were  admitted  without  objection.  (Transcript  (Tr.)  17-21; \\nGovernment  Exhibit  (GE)  1-7;  Applicant  Exhibit  (AE)  A-R)  On  December  22,  2015,  I \\nreceived a transcript of the hearing.   \\n\\n  \\n\\nFindings of Fact \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nIn  Applicant’s  SOR  response,  he  denied  all  of  the  SOR  allegations.  Applicant \\nadmitted the information in amended SOR ¶ 1.b. Applicant’s admissions are accepted \\nas findings of fact.  \\n \\n\\nApplicant is a 56-year-old software engineer employed by Company D, a defense \\ncontractor from 1980 to 2007. (Tr. 179, 214; AE A) From 2008 to present, he has been \\nemployed by another defense contractor. (AE A) In January 2011, Applicant’s security \\nclearance was suspended. (GE 2; AE E)  \\n\\n \\nIn 1998, Applicant married. (Tr. 235) His spouse is a missile engineer, and she \\nhas a security clearance. (Tr. 216) He has two daughters who are 14 and 15. (Tr. 215) \\nHis  father  was  a  career  Navy  officer.  (Tr.  215)  His  two  older  brothers  served  in  the \\nNavy. (Tr. 215) His nephew was a Navy Seal, who served three tours in Afghanistan. \\n(Tr. 215) Applicant never served in the military. (Tr. 235) \\n\\n \\nCompany D funded Applicant’s college tuition, and in 1982, Applicant received a \\nbachelor  of  science  degree  in  mathematics.  (Tr.  178-179,  235;  AE  A)  After  1982, \\nApplicant worked on a variety of Navy contracts for Company D.  Sometimes he was \\nemployed at Company D, but detailed to work on Company L managed projects. (Tr. \\n180) During Desert Shield, he was deployed for six months to the Persian Gulf aboard a \\nU.S. Navy vessel. (Tr. 180) \\n\\n \\n2 \\n                                         \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "In 1999, Applicant was one of the architects of a program for a simulation test of \\npart of a weapons system developed by Company L by utilizing unclassified data. (Tr. \\n184;  GE  5;  GE  6)  From  1999  to  2007,  Applicant  was  instrumental  in  the  program \\ndevelopment. (Tr. 184-189). In November 2007, Applicant went to the Pentagon, and in \\nthe  presence  of  an  admiral,  was  shown  some  design  charts,  which  Applicant  had \\ndeveloped on behalf of Company D, and Company L had previously presented without \\nauthorization to the Navy. (Tr. 189) Applicant believed the information was improperly \\ntaken from Company D by Company L.  \\n\\n \\n\\nHandling Protected Information and Personal Conduct1  \\n\\n \\nApplicant was the leader of a team of technicians working on a Navy project. (Tr. \\n99; GE 5 at 1-2) On about 75 occasions over several years, Company L employees or \\nNavy personnel provided “trusted downloads” on flash drives or compact discs, which \\nwere supposed to be unclassified data or software that Applicant and his team could \\nuse  for  analysis.  (Tr.  94,  99-103;  GE  6  at  7)  Technicians  were  concerned  that  a  file \\nmarked  unclassified  might  actually  contain  classified  data.  (Tr.  87)  The  only  way \\nclassified information could be placed on unclassified computers was through an error \\nin  the  trusted-download  process,  or  a  deliberate  improper  transfer  of  classified \\ninformation. (Tr. 78) Applicant was not authorized to make a trusted download, and he \\ndenied knowingly transferring classified information to an unclassified computer. (Tr. 78)  \\nThere are eight or nine people that could have been responsible for entering data that \\nwas too close to the thresholds to be unclassified. (Tr. 214) \\n\\n \\nApplicant’s team’s project utilized a classified version and an unclassified version \\nof a computer program. The classified version used “a set of parameters, thresholds, \\nwhich [were] put together along with the executable part of the program” to generate a \\n“classified  result.”  (Tr.  100,  107)  The  classified  numbers  changed  as  the  project \\nadvanced.  (Tr.  122-123)  M  was  a  key  person  in  deciding  whether  data  should  be \\nclassified or not. (Tr. 128) The unclassified version of the program used numbers that \\nwere not representative of the real system to simulate interactions, which allowed use of \\nlaptops and communications in an unclassified environment and improved productivity. \\n(Tr. 100-101, 107) The non-representative numbers were used “to test the mechanics of \\nthe  program”  and  debug  problems  in  an  unclassified  environment.  (Tr.  108)  The \\nclassified numbers were not supposed to be used on unclassified computers. (Tr. 112) \\nM assumed the computer he was issued was from Company L and not from DOD. (Tr. \\n113) The unclassified versions could be used at home. (Tr. 100-102) Employees were \\nallowed to use company-issued computers for some personal use; however, extensive \\npersonal use was discouraged. (Tr. 124) At Company L, if a spillage was discovered, \\nCompany L’s facility security officer (FSO) was supposed to be notified. (Tr. 115) The \\nFSO was responsible for ensuring the file was deleted from computers. (Tr. 116) After \\ndeletion of the file, security used a cleaning program to scramble the computer memory. \\n\\n                                            \\n\\n1Unless stated otherwise, the source for the information in this section is a December 16, 2010, \\nletter from an FBI special agent written to the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) about \\nthe investigation of Applicant for unauthorized removal and retention of classified documents or material \\nin possible violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1924. (GE 3)   \\n\\n \\n3 \\n                                         \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "(Tr.  116)  Applicant  had  access  to  classified  versions  of  the  program  and  classified \\nprogram data. (Tr. 118) \\n\\n \\nEmployees  of  Companies  D  and  L  sought  to  maintain  separation  between  the \\nclassified  and  unclassified  versions.  (Tr.  101,  106-108)  In  2008,  the  security  people \\ninterviewed employees and borrowed computers with the programs on their computers \\nto check for a data spill. (Tr. 102) Security found files containing classified information \\non the computers of four to seven employees of Company L, including on M’s computer. \\n(Tr.  102-103,  118-121)  Security  performed  cleansing  operations  on  the  computers  to \\neliminate  the  files  with  classified  information.  (Tr.  102-103,  118-121)  Because  of  the \\nspillage,  the  whole  unclassified-simulation  program  was  terminated,  and  all  future \\nsimulation work was done on the classified side. (Tr. 119, 124) Team members worked \\non  different  areas  of  the  program.  (Tr.  104-105)  Their  work  would  be  subsequently \\nmerged,  which  could  cause  classified  data  to  be  unknowingly  transferred  from  one \\ncomputer to another, and no one would know the origin of the classified information. (Tr. \\n104-105)      \\n\\n \\n4 \\n                                         \\n \\n\\n \\nIn December 2007, Applicant received a trusted download onto a flash drive from \\nthe  Navy  for  evaluation  of  Applicant  and  his  team.  (Tr.  221;  GE  5;  GE  6)  The \\ninformation was supposed to unclassified. Classified files from downloads were labeled \\nwith a C, and unclassified files from trusted downloads were labeled with a T for test. \\n(Tr. 192) In December 2007, B, a GS-13, who was the senior Navy employee on the \\nteam,  was  at  Applicant’s  residence,  when  they  were  doing  some computer  work.  (Tr. \\n92, 192) Applicant inserted a flash drive into B’s laptop computer and was surprised to \\nsee a file starting with a C, which meant the file could be classified.

(GE 4) \\n\\n \\nOn  January  28,  2008,  Company  D’s  FSO  called  Applicant  and  asked  him  to \\nprovide his two DOD-issued laptop computers to Company L. (Tr. 196, 229) One of the \\nrequested laptop computers was at Applicant’s home. (Tr. 197-199) The FSO did not \\nexplain why the computers were requested. (Tr. 199) Applicant said he would bring the \\ncomputers the next day, and the FSO did not insist or demand that Applicant provide \\nthe computer sooner. (GE 6 at 6) Applicant did not believe there had been classified \\ninformation on the laptop computers.

Two  subject  matter  experts  (SMEs),  who  were \\nassociated with Applicant’s team, reviewed the “unclassified data” on the hard drive and \\ndetermined  that  there was  probably  classified  data  on  the  computer.  (Tr.  76-77,  205, \\n213;  GE  6  at  2-3)  Most  of  the  information  was  unclassified;  however,  the  classified \\ninformation  was  one  table  of  numbers  or  parameters,  and  none  of  the  SMEs  were \\naware  of  how  the  classified  table  had  migrated  from  the  classified  system  to  the \\nunclassified  system.  (Tr.  77,  88,  90,  213,  232-233)  In  February  2008,  Applicant \\ncontacted Company D’s FSO and advised her of the possibility of confidential data on \\nteam computers. The computers were collected to detect any spillage. (Tr. 205-206; GE \\n6 at 4) One of the SMEs also contacted his FSO about the possible spillage. (Tr. 206)   \\n\\n \\nApplicant  consulted  a  Navy  captain,  who  advised  Applicant  to  seek  the \\nassistance of counsel, and in February 2008, he hired a counsel with significant national \\nsecurity  experience.  (Tr.  203;  GE  5  at  2;  GE  6  at  4;  AE  M)  On  March  4,  2008, \\nApplicant’s  counsel  disclosed  to  the  FBI  that  Applicant  deleted  the  Company  D \\nproprietary files because Company L had requested the computers.

NCIS  requested  the  two  computers  in  February \\n2008. (Tr. 141; AE B) Applicant had saved tax returns and other personal information on \\nthe  desktop  computer.  The  desk  top  computer  was  obsolete  and  lacked  sufficient \\ncomputer  power  to  run  simulations,  and  Applicant  believed  it  had  no  risk  of  having \\nclassified data on it. (Tr. 210) Applicant’s attorney wanted to find out whether the two \\ncomputers were owned by Applicant, Company D, or DOD before providing them to the \\nFBI  or  NCIS.  (Tr.  141)  With  the  assistance  of  Company  D,  Applicant’s  attorney \\ndetermined  the  two  computers  were  probably  owned  by  DOD.

(Tr. 228-230) Applicant deleted the Company D proprietary information.

(Tr. \\n156-159,  210,  212)  The  discs  were  marked  unclassified.

(Tr.  150;  AE  C)  The  forensic  examination  determined  that  classified \\nmaterials had been stored on one of the laptop computers. FBI SMEs, who were not \\nrelated to Applicant’s team, reviewed the “classified values” and concluded 11 values \\nwere not sufficiently scrambled to render them unclassified. (Tr. 213; GE 3; GE 5 at 3; \\nAE P) The classification level was deemed to be confidential. (AE L; AE P) Applicant \\nbelieved the FBI SMEs erred in the manner that some of the numbers were “reverse \\nengineered”  and  classified  as  confidential  or  secret.  (GE  6  at  5)  The  FBI  had  been \\nrelying  on  erroneous  information  from  SMEs,  and  the  FBI  SMEs  had  mistakenly \\nconfused some of the unclassified testing numbers with classified data. (Tr. 151, 154, \\n211; GE 3) Applicant agreed with the FBI that one table contained classified numbers. \\n(Tr.  151-154;  GE  5  at  2-3)  Applicant  conceded  his  unclassified  computer  should  not \\nhave  been  used  for  classified  information  because  it  did  not  contain  the  security \\nmeasures required for storage of classified material. (Tr. 155-156)  \\n\\n \\nThe AUSA appeared to accept that Applicant was involved in an inadvertent spill \\nof  classified  numbers  as  opposed  to  a  deliberate  attempt  to  compromise  classified \\ninformation.

As  Commander  in  Chief,  the  President  has  the \\nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \\nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. \\nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \\napplicant’s  eligibility  for  access  to  classified  information  “only  upon  a  finding  that  it  is \\nclearly  consistent  with  the  national  interest  to  do  so.”  Exec.  Or.  10865,  Safeguarding \\nClassified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  \\n \\n\\nEligibility  for  a  security  clearance  is  predicated  upon  the  applicant  meeting  the \\ncriteria  contained  in  the  revised  adjudicative  guidelines.  These  guidelines  are  not \\ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \\nguidelines  are  applied  in  conjunction  with  an  evaluation  of  the  whole  person.  An \\nadministrative \\nimpartial,  and \\ncommonsense  decision.  An  administrative  judge  must  consider  all  available,  reliable \\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \\n\\njudge’s  overarching  adjudicative  goal \\n\\n  \\nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \\naccess  to  classified  information.  This  relationship  transcends  normal  duty  hours  and \\nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \\npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \\nabout  potential,  rather  than  actual,  risk  of  compromise  of  classified  information. \\nClearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \\n\\nis  a \\n\\nfair, \\n\\n \\n8 \\n                                         \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. \\nThis decision is not based, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination \\nabout applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. Thus, any decision to deny a security \\nclearance  is  merely  an  indication  the  applicant  has  not  met  the  strict  guidelines  the \\nPresident and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  \\n\\n \\n \\nInitially,  the  Government  must  establish,  by  substantial  evidence,  conditions  in \\nthe  personal  or  professional  history  of  the  applicant  that  may  disqualify  the  applicant \\nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \\nof  establishing  controverted  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR.

The guidelines \\npresume  a  nexus  or  rational  connection  between  proven  conduct  under  any  of  the \\ncriteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \\nat 2 (App. Bd.

Sept. 24, 2013).  \\n\\n \\nThree mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 17 are potentially applicable:  \\n \\n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \\nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \\nunlikely  to  recur  and  does  not  cast  doubt  on  the  individual's  reliability, \\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \\n \\n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \\nto  change  the  behavior  or  taken  other  positive  steps  to  alleviate  the \\nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \\nor  other  inappropriate  behavior,  and  such  behavior  is  unlikely  to  recur;  \\nand \\n \\n(e)  the  individual  has  taken  positive  steps  to  reduce  or  eliminate \\nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \\n \\nAG ¶ 16(e) is mitigated by AG ¶ 17(e) because Applicant has fully disclosed his \\nrule violations. Law enforcement, security officials, and his witnesses are well aware of \\nhis  security-related  conduct,  and he  is not  vulnerable  to  exploitation, manipulation,  or \\nduress because of his security-related conduct. \\n\\n \\nAG ¶¶ 17(c) and 17(d) apply. The only evidence of Applicant’s December 2007 \\nsecurity breach was Applicant’s self-report; however, his self-report was not timely, as it \\nappears  it  was  disclosed  at  his  August  19,  2010  AUSA  proffer.  However,  Applicant’s \\nfailure to report the December 2007 security breach is not recent; the security breach \\nwas  inadvertent;  “it  happened  under  such  unique  circumstances  that  it  is  unlikely  to \\nrecur;”  and  it  “does  not  cast  doubt  on  Applicant’s  reliability,  trustworthiness,  or  good \\njudgment.”  He  admitted  that  he  showed  poor  judgment  in  December  2007  when  he \\ndiscovered that he had downloaded possible classified information onto B’s computer \\nand his own computer, and he failed to report this security breach to his FSO (SOR ¶ \\n\\n \\n11 \\n                                         \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "1.a).  Security  needed  to  assess  the  scope  of  the  breach  of  security  or  spillage,  and \\nsecurity was unable to check other computers and determine who was responsible for \\nthe “trusted download” that caused the security breach.  \\n\\n \\nApplicant  understands  the  importance  of  informing  security  of  any  security \\nbreach or possible security breach, and I am confident he will timely disclosed required \\ninformation. Personal conduct concerns are mitigated. Even if security concerns are not \\nmitigated under Guideline E, they are mitigated under the whole-person concept, infra. \\n \\nHandling Protected Information  \\n \\n  \\nAG  ¶  33  articulates  the  security  concern  relating  to  handling  protected \\ninformation  as  follows,  “Deliberate  or  negligent  failure  to  comply  with  rules  and \\nregulations for protecting classified or other sensitive information raises doubt about an \\nindividual’s trustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or willingness and ability to safeguard \\nsuch information, and is a serious security concern.” \\n\\n \\nAG  ¶  34  provides  three  disqualifying  conditions  that  could  raise  a  security \\n\\n  \\nconcern and may be disqualifying in this case:  \\n \\n\\n(b) collecting or storing classified or other protected information at home or \\nin any other unauthorized location; \\n \\n(c) loading, drafting, editing, modifying, storing, transmitting, or otherwise \\nhandling classified reports, data, or other information on any unapproved \\nequipment including but not limited to any typewriter, word processor, or \\ncomputer  hardware,  software,  drive,  system,  gameboard,  handheld, \\n\"palm\" or pocket device or other adjunct equipment; and \\n \\n(g) any failure to comply with rules for the protection of classified or other \\nsensitive information. \\n\\n \\n\\nAG ¶¶ 34(b), 34(c), and 34(g) apply. These three disqualifying conditions do not \\ninclude  a  requirement  that  Applicant  knew  he  was  downloading  classified  information \\nonto  an  unclassified  system,  and  they  do  not  require  that  he  be  aware  that  his \\nunclassified computer systems contain classified information.  \\n\\n \\nSOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.c discussed previously are cross-alleged under SOR ¶¶ 2.a \\nand  2.c.  In  December  2007,  Applicant  discovered  that  he  had  downloaded  possible \\nclassified  information  onto  B’s  computer  and  his  own  computer.  The  two  computers \\nwere not authorized for storage of classified information.   \\n\\n \\nThe hard drive of one of Applicant’s DOD-issued laptop computers was restricted \\nto unclassified information use, and a forensic evaluation and SME review found that his \\nlaptop computer contained some data classified at the confidential level. Applicant was \\nunaware  this  computer  contained  classified  information.  He  is  not  responsible  for \\n\\n \\n12 \\n                                         \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "“trusted  downloads,”  and  he  inadvertently  downloaded  classified  information  from  a \\ntrusted download onto his hard drive.  \\n\\n \\nThree mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 35 are potentially applicable:  \\n\\n \\n\\n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior, or it has happened so \\ninfrequently  or  under  such  unusual  circumstances,  that  it  is  unlikely  to \\nrecur  and  does  not  cast  doubt  on  the  individual's  current  reliability, \\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \\n \\n(b) the individual responded favorably to counseling or remedial security \\ntraining and now demonstrates a positive attitude toward the discharge of \\nsecurity responsibilities; and \\n \\n(c) the security violations were due to improper or inadequate training. \\n  \\nAG ¶¶ 35(a) through 35(c) apply. As indicated in the previous section, AG ¶ 35(a) \\nis  established.  The  particular  simulation  program  involving  inadvertent  transfers  of \\nclassified data to unclassified systems was changed to a completely classified system. \\nSuch  erroneous  “trusted  downloads”  will  not  recur.  Applicant  understands  how \\nimportant it is to avoid future transfers of classified information to unclassified computer \\nsystems.  He  has  been  counseled  and  understands  that  when  a  security  violation  is \\ndiscovered, it should be timely reported to his FSO. He has a positive attitude towards \\nconscientiously complying with security requirements.  \\n\\n \\nApplicant’s  actions  since  March  2008  show  sufficient  effort,  good  judgment, \\n  \\ntrustworthiness,  and  reliability  to  warrant  mitigation  of  handling  protected  information \\nsecurity  concerns.  Even  if  handling  protected  information  concerns  are  not  mitigated \\nunder Guideline K, they are mitigated under the whole-person concept, infra.    \\n\\n \\n\\nWhole-Person Concept \\n\\n \\n Under  the  whole-person  concept,  the  administrative  judge  must  evaluate  an \\nApplicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s \\nconduct  and all  the  circumstances. The  administrative  judge  should  consider  the nine \\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  \\n\\nthe  conduct, \\n\\nthe  nature,  extent,  and  seriousness  of \\nto \\n\\nthe  conduct;  (2) \\nthe \\n(1) \\ncircumstances  surrounding \\ninclude  knowledgeable \\nparticipation;  (3)  the  frequency  and  recency  of  the  conduct;  (4)  the \\nindividual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \\nwhich  participation \\nthe  presence  or  absence  of \\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \\nfor  the  conduct;  (8)  the  potential  for  pressure,  coercion,  exploitation,  or \\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \\n\\nis  voluntary;  (6) \\n\\n \\n13 \\n                                         \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "Under  AG  ¶  2(c),  the  ultimate  determination  of  whether  to  grant  eligibility  for  a \\nsecurity  clearance  must  be  an  overall  commonsense  judgment  based  upon  careful \\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \\ncomments under Guidelines E and K in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors \\nin AG ¶ 2(a)  were addressed under Guidelines  E and K, but some warrant additional \\ncomment. \\n\\n  \\nApplicant is a 56-year-old software engineer employed by Company D from 1980 \\nto 2007. From 2008 to present, he has been employed by another defense contractor. \\nHis spouse is a security clearance holder; his father was a career Navy officer; his two \\nolder brothers served in the Navy; and his nephew was a Navy Seal, who served three \\ntours  in  Afghanistan.  In  1982,  Applicant  received  a  bachelor  of  science  degree  in \\nmathematics.  During  Desert  Shield,  Applicant  was  deployed  for  six  months  to  the \\nPersian Gulf aboard a U.S. Navy vessel.   \\n\\n \\nA Navy captain, who has known Applicant since the late 1990s; a high-level DOD \\nemployee, who has oversight authority over about 9,000 of DOD employees and a $300 \\nmillion budget and who has known Applicant since the 1990s; a program director on a \\nproject,  who  has  known  Applicant  since  2003;  two  contractors,  who  worked  with \\nApplicant  on  the  project  at  issue;  and  Applicant’s  attorney  described  Applicant  in \\nlaudatory  terms.  Applicant  is  an  “incredibly  gifted,”  exceptionally  creative,  and \\n“incredibly skilled” technician and engineer. He is diligent, intelligent, professional, open, \\ncandid, honest, and conscientious about the protection of classified information. Most of \\nhis  character  witnesses  were  aware  of  the  SOR  allegations,  had  read  Applicant’s \\nstatements in 2011 and 2013, and recommended reinstatement of Applicant’s security \\nclearance.  \\n\\n \\nApplicant’s  SOR  allegations  relate  to  his  handling  of  confidential  information  in \\nDecember  2007  and  January  2008  and  participation  in  the  follow-up  investigation  in \\n2009  and  2010.  Company  L  or  Navy  employees  provided  “trusted  downloads”  to \\nApplicant and his team. The trusted downloads were not supposed to contain classified \\ndata or software; however, there was some classified data mixed in with the unclassified \\ndata. Applicant and other members of his team unknowingly downloaded the classified \\nand  unclassified  information  onto  computers  allocated  to  unclassified  information. \\nApplicant  did  not  compromise  classified  information  as  there  is  no  evidence  the \\nunclassified  computers  were  used  by  anyone  not  authorized  to  review  the  classified \\ninformation. In December 2007, Applicant discovered possible classified information on \\nhis unclassified computer and on B’s computer. B and Applicant agreed that they should \\ndelete  it,  and  they  did  so.  This  error  was  aggravated  when  Applicant  and  B  failed  to \\ndisclose the discovery of the probable classified information on the flash drive and their \\ncomputers  to  their  FSOs.  Applicant  did  not  receive  adequate  training  or  supervision \\nfrom  B,  a  GS-13  Navy  employee  on  this  occasion.  There  was  no  evidence  that \\nApplicant was told prior to December 2007 of the protocol after discovery of possible \\nclassified information on an unclassified computer.  \\n\\n \\nAfter  two  of  Applicant’s  assigned  DOD-issued  computers  were  requested,  he \\ndeleted Company D proprietary information and personal information before providing \\n\\n \\n14 \\n                                         \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "one  computer  to  Company  D  and  one  computer to  NCIS. These deletions  raised  the \\npossibility  that  he  was  intentionally  obstructing  the  investigation  because  forensic \\nexamination revealed there were deletions, but could not determine the content of the \\ndeletions.  Applicant  provided  the  only  evidence  of  the  content  of  the  deletions.  In \\nFebruary  2008,  after  Applicant  made  the  deletions,  he  hired  an  experienced  national \\nsecurity attorney who advised him to cooperate with the investigation. After March 2008, \\nApplicant  cooperated  with  the  investigation,  and  his  attorney  notified  the  FBI  that  he \\nwould assist the investigation. His errors in judgment were made from December 2007 \\nthrough February 2008 and are not recent.   \\n\\n \\nApplicant’s hearing statement was credible. He understands what he needs to do \\nto maintain his eligibility for access to classified information. He has avoided any hint of \\nviolation  of  his  employer’s  rules  or  security  rules  after  March  2008.  He  expressed \\nsincere remorse for his infractions of security rules and errors in judgment in December \\n2007  and  January  2008,  and  he  emphasized  his  determination  to  conscientiously \\ncomply  with  all  security  rules  and  requirements.  I  am  confident  he  will  continue  to \\nconscientiously exercise his security responsibilities in the future. \\n\\n    \\nI  have  carefully  applied  the  law,  as  set  forth  in  Egan,  Exec.  Or.  10865,  the \\nDirective,  and  the  AGs,  to  the  facts  and  circumstances  in  the  context  of  the  whole \\nperson.

Applicant  did  not  respond  to  the  FORM.  I  was \\nassigned the case on December 1, 2015. Based on a thorough review of the case file, I \\nfind that Applicant failed to carry his burden in mitigating security concerns arising under \\nboth Guideline B and Guideline E.  \\n\\n     Findings of Fact \\n\\n \\nApplicant  is  a  71-year-old  man  who  is  presently  not  working  while  his  security \\nclearance is updated. He has earned a high school diploma. He was divorced in 1998 \\n                                                           \\n1 The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \\nSecurity  Clearance  Review  Program  (January  2,  1992),  as  amended  (Directive);  and  the  adjudicative \\nguidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on September 1, 2006. \\n\\n1 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\n",
       "and is now estranged from a subsequent spouse. Facts about this estranged female are \\nunclear,  although  it  appears  she  is  from  Russia,  where  she  currently  resides  with  or \\nnear  family.  He  provided  incomplete  information  on  his  security  clearance  application \\n(SCA)  about  his  family  and  children.  Other  discrepancies  appear  throughout  his \\ninvestigatory record. Applicant presently lives in another country with a female foreign \\nnational  in  order  to  reduce  the  costs  he  would  otherwise  expend  living  in  the  United \\nStates while awaiting a return to work.  \\n \\n \\nAt issue in the SOR are the following facts: Applicant has a wife who is a citizen \\nand resident of Russia.2 They are estranged, but Applicant has no plans to divorce his \\nforeign  wife  because  he  no  longer  believes  in  divorce.  He  has  a  daughter  who  is  a \\ncitizen  of  the  United  States  and  is  currently  a  resident  of  Russia,  where  she  is  a \\nuniversity student. He also has parents-in-law who are citizens and residents of Russia. \\nApplicant met them in about July 1998 on a visit to their home. He again saw them on a \\nsubsequent  trip  to  Russia  with  his  wife.  He  has  had  no  other  contact  with  them  and \\ndoes not know how often his estranged wife currently has with her parents now that all \\nthree  are  in  Russia.  His  father-in-law  and  mother-in-law  are  a  teacher  and  a \\ngynecologist,  respectively.  Applicant  assumed  they  were  Communists  because  the \\nCommunists were in power when he met them. As of 2015, Russia is one of the two \\nleading state intelligence threats to United States interests, based on their capabilities, \\nintent,  and  broad  operational  scopes.3  Applicant  admits  the  Guideline  B  SOR \\nallegations, but did not address them in any manner in his SOR Response.     \\n \\n \\nIn completing SCAs in both August 3, 2009, and March 23, 2013, Applicant failed \\nto  list  multiple  names  he  has  used,  places  of  former  residence,  periods  of \\nunemployment, relatives, and foreign contacts. He told an investigator in 2010 that he \\nhad no problems while working with a particular employer, but later conceded he was \\ninvolved in a harassment suit while working there. Despite a 2010 claim to the contrary, \\nhe failed in 2007 to file an appropriate contact with foreign nationals report regarding the \\nforeign woman with whom he currently cohabitates. Applicant admits these allegations.  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\nPolicies \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nWhen  evaluating  an  applicant’s  suitability \\n\\n \\n \\nthe \\nadministrative  judge  must  consider  the  adjudicative  guidelines.  In  addition  to  brief \\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \\ndisqualifying  conditions  and  mitigating  conditions,  which  are  used  in  evaluating  an \\napplicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. \\n \\n\\nfor  a  security  clearance, \\n\\nThese  guidelines  are  not  inflexible  rules  of  law.  Instead,  recognizing  the \\ncomplexities  of  human  behavior,  these  guidelines  are  applied  in  conjunction  with  the \\n                                                           \\n2  In  some  records  within  the  FORM,  Applicant  indicated  that  his  estranged  wife  became  a  naturalized \\ncitizen in 2007 or 2008 and now resides in the United States, but the discrepancies are never resolved. \\n(See FORM, Item 6) \\n \\n3 FORM, Item 9, at 3. \\n\\n2 \\n\\n\n",
       "factors  listed  in  the  adjudicative  process.  The  administrative  judge’s  overarching \\nadjudicative  goal  is  a  fair,  impartial,  and  commonsense  decision.  According  to  AG  ¶ \\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \\nthe  “whole-person  concept.”  The  administrative  judge  must  consider  all  available, \\nreliable information about the person in making a decision. \\n\\n \\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) \\nrequires  that  “[a]ny  doubt  concerning  personnel  being  considered  for  access  to \\nclassified  information  will  be  resolved  in  favor  of  national  security.”  In  reaching  this \\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \\non the evidence contained in the record.  \\n\\n \\nUnder Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \\ncontroverted  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  Under  Directive  ¶  E3.1.15,  an  “applicant  is \\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \\nmitigate  facts  admitted  by  applicant  or  proven  by  Department  Counsel  and  has  the \\nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.”  \\n\\nthe  Government  predicated  upon \\n\\n \\nA  person  who  seeks  access  to  classified  information  enters  into  a  fiduciary \\nrelationship  with \\ntrust  and  confidence.  This \\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \\nGovernment  reposes  a  high  degree  of  trust  and  confidence  in  individuals  to  whom  it \\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \\nthe  possible  risk  the  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  safeguard \\nclassified information. Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall \\nbe “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \\nloyalty of the applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b).  \\n\\nThe security concern relating to the Guideline B is set out in AG ¶ 6: \\n\\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \\nany  foreign  interest.  Adjudication  under  this  Guideline  can  and  should \\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \\nfinancial \\nto,  such \\nconsiderations  as  whether  the  foreign  country  is  known  to  target  United \\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \\nrisk of terrorism. \\n\\nincluding,  but  not \\n\\nlocated, \\n\\ninterest \\n\\nlimited \\n\\nis \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n3 \\n\\nAnalysis \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\n",
       "Applicant remains married to the female of Russian origin at issue. Therefore, it \\ncan be assumed he maintains some level of affection for this woman, the mother of his \\nchild. It can also be assumed he maintains a bond or ties of affection for their child, who \\nis  now  studying  at  a  Russian  college.  As  for  his  in-laws,  while  their  contact  with \\nApplicant is negligible, it can be assumed his estranged partner has ties of affection with \\nher own parents. Those ties are routinely attributed to the spouse (Applicant) in these \\ncases. Given these facts, disqualifying conditions AG ¶¶ 7(a) and (b) apply:  \\n \\n\\nto  protect  sensitive \\n\\nAG ¶ 7(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \\nassociate,  friend,  or  other  person  who  is  a  citizen  of  or  resident  in  a \\nforeign  country  if  that  contact  creates  a  heightened  risk  of  foreign \\nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \\n \\nAG ¶ 7(b) connection to a foreign person, group, government, or country \\nthat  create  a  potential  conflict  of  interest  between  the  individual’s \\nobligation \\nthe \\nindividual’s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \\nthat information. \\n \\nIn  finding  disqualifying  conditions  applicable,  I  specifically  note  that  AG  ¶  7(a) \\nrequires substantial evidence of a heightened risk. The heightened risk required to raise \\na  disqualifying  condition  is  a  relatively  low  standard.  Heightened  risk  denotes  a  risk \\ngreater than the normal risk inherent in having a family member living under a foreign \\ngovernment or substantial assets in a foreign nation. Russia is one of the two leading \\nstate intelligence threats to United States interests. In addition, foreign family ties can \\npose a security risk even without a connection to a foreign government. This is because \\nan applicant may be subject to coercion or undue influence when a third party pressures \\nor  threatens  an  applicant’s family  members.  Under  these facts,  while  unlikely,  a  third \\nparty  coercion  concern  potentially  exists  in  Russia.  Therefore,  there  is  sufficient \\nevidence to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \\n\\ninformation  or \\n\\ntechnology  and \\n\\n  \\nAG ¶ 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \\n\\nof the mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 8, and find the following are relevant: \\n \\n\\nAG ¶ 8(a) the nature of the relationship with foreign persons, the country in \\nwhich  these  persons  are  located,  or  the  positions  or  activities  of  those \\npersons  in  that  country  are  such  that  it  is  unlikely  the  individual  will  be \\nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \\nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.; \\nand \\n\\n \\n\\nAG  ¶  8(b)  there  is  no  conflict  of  interest,  either  because  the  individual’s \\nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or \\ncountry  is  so  minimal,  or  the  individual  has  such  deep  and  longstanding \\nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to \\nresolve any conflict of interests in favor of the U.S. interests.  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n4 \\n\\n\n",
       "The mere possession of close family ties to persons in a foreign country is not, \\nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in \\na foreign country and an applicant has frequent, non-casual contacts with that relative, \\nthis  factor  alone  is  sufficient  to  create  the  potential  for  foreign  influence  and  could \\npotentially result in the compromise of classified information.  \\n\\n \\nHere,  Applicant  provided  scant  information about  his estranged  wife,  daughter, \\nand  in-laws.  Indeed,  information  about  his  in-laws  is  more  abundant  than  information \\nabout his child and her mother. While his personal ties to his in-laws may be weak, their \\nimpact on Applicant cannot be discerned without more information about his wife and \\nchild. Under these limited facts, no mitigating conditions weigh in Applicant’s favor. \\n\\nThe  security  concern  for  personal  conduct  is  set  out  in  AG  ¶  15,  where  the \\nsignificance of conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \\nunwillingness  to  comply  with  rules  and  regulations  is  defined  ([p]ersonal  conduct  can \\nraise  questions  about  an  individual’s  reliability,  trustworthiness  and  ability  to  protect \\nclassified  information).  Of  special  interest  is  any  failure to  provide  truthful and  candid \\nanswers during the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the \\nsecurity clearance process.  \\n\\n \\nIn completing his 2009 and 2013 SCAs, Applicant’s answers in many areas were \\neither deficient or in conflict. His answers in a 2010 interview were either intentionally or \\nnegligently incomplete  with regard to past  workplace problems and the reporting of a \\nforeign  cohabitant  to  his  former  employer.  If  these  inaccuracies  were  intentionally \\nincorrect, such facts could give rise to:  \\n\\n \\nAG  ¶  16(a)  deliberate  omission,  concealment,  or  falsification  of  relevant \\nfacts \\nfrom  any  personnel  security  questionnaire,  personal  history \\nstatement,  or  similar  form  used  to  conduct  investigations,  determine \\nemployment  qualifications,  award  benefits  or  status,  determine  security \\nclearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities, \\nand  \\n \\nAG  ¶  16(b)  deliberately  providing \\ninformation \\nconcerning  relevant  facts  to  an  employer,  investigator,  security  official, \\ncompetent medical authority, or other official government representative. \\n \\nApplicant admitted all three allegations raised under Guideline E and provided no \\nexplanations or commentary. While his admission to the SCA discrepancies could be \\ndiscounted and his discrepancies found to be the product of negligence, this guideline \\ncould  be  found  in  his  favor.  In  admitting  allegations  that  he  knowingly  withheld \\ninformation and denied having had problems while employed at a place where he was \\ninvolved in a harassment suit, however, the facts tend to indicate that these answers – \\nwithout  more  –  were  intentionally  false  or  misleading.  This  is  particularly  true  in  the \\n5 \\n\\nfalse  or  misleading \\n\\n \\n\\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "absence  of  some  explanation  claiming  forgetfulness  or  another  basis  for  having \\nprovided a negligently entered SCA answer. Therefore, given his admissions, none of \\nthe mitigating conditions at AG ¶ 17(a) – (g) apply.  \\n\\nWhole-Person Concept \\n \\n \\nUnder  the  whole-person  concept,  the  administrative  judge  must  evaluate  an \\napplicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s \\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a). Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) \\nwere addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment.  \\n \\n \\nApplicant failed to do more than admit the allegations raised in the SOR. He then \\nrequested a judgment based on the written record. It is that very record that is full of \\ndiscrepancies  and  contradictions  that  contributed  to  the  security  concerns  at  issue. \\nThere  are  simply  insufficient  facts  to  evaluate  Applicant’s  foreign  kin,  the  SCA  and \\ninterview inaccuracies, or even the Applicant as an individual. This is simply the result of \\na  deficiently  supplemented  record.  Without  more,  there  is  insufficient  information  to \\nrebut, refute, or mitigate the security concerns raised under the foreign influence and \\npersonal conduct guidelines.   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nFOREIGN INFLUENCE  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nAllegations 1.a-1.c:   \\n\\nPERSONAL CONDUCT \\n  \\n \\n\\nAllegations 2.a-2.c:   \\n\\n \\n\\nFormal Findings \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nAGAINST APPLICANT \\n\\nAgainst Applicant \\n\\nAGAINST APPLICANT \\n\\nAgainst Applicant  \\n\\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n     Conclusion \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \\nclearly  consistent  with  the  national  interest  to  grant  Applicant  a  security  clearance. \\nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n                                             \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n_____________________________ \\n\\n \\n\\nArthur E.
